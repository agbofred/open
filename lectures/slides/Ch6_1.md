## Representations
- Focusing today on how a computer can internally store more complex and abstract information
- Initially will look at numbers
- Then we'll bring it back to strings

## Bit Power
- The fundamental unit of memory inside a computer is called a _bit_
	- Coined from a contraction of the words binary and digit
- An individual bit exists in one of two states, usually denoted as **0** or **1**.
- More complex data can be represented by combining larger numbers of bits:
	- Two bits can represent 4 ($2\times 2$) values
	- Three bits can represent 8 ($2\times2\times2$) values
	- Four bits can represent 16 ($2\times2\times2\times2$ or $2^4$) values, etc
- My laptop here has 8GB of system memory, and can therefore keep track of approximately $2^{80000000000}$ states!


## An old code, but it checks out
::::::cols
::::col
- Binary notation is an old idea
	- Described by German mathematician Leibniz back in 1703
- Leibniz describes his use of binary notation in an easy to follow style
- Leibniz's paper notes that the Chinese had discovered binary arithmetic 2000 years earlier, as illustrated by the patterns of lines in the _I Ching_!

## Representing Integers
- The number of symbols available to count with determines the _base_ of a number system
	- Decimal is base 10, as we have 10 symbols (0-9) to count with
		- Each new number counts for 10 times as much as the previous
	- Binary is base 2, as we only have 2 symbols (0 and 1) to count with
		- Each new number counts for twice as much as the previous
- Can always determine what number a representation corresponds to by adding up the individual contributions

every node/.style={draw, thick, MGreen, font=\Large}

\node(1) at (0,0) {0};
\node[right=0cm of 1](1) {0};
\node[right=0cm of 1](1) {1};

\node[right=0cm of 1](1) {0};
\node[right=0cm of 1](1) {1};
\node[right=0cm of 1](1) {0};
\end{tikzpicture}


## Specifying Bases
- So the binary number 00101010 is equivalent to the decimal number 42
- We distinguish by subsetting the bases:
	$$ 00101010_2 = 42_{10}$$
- **The number itself still is the same! All that changes is how we represent that number.**
	- Numbers do not have bases -- representations of numbers have bases

## Other Bases
- Binary is not a particularly compact representation to write out, so computer scientists will often use more compact representations as well
	- _Octal_ (base 8) uses the digits 0 to 7
	- _Hexadecimal_ (base 16) uses the digits 0 to 9 and then the letters A through F

- Why octal or hexadecimal over our trusty old decimal system?
	- Both are powers of 2, so it makes it easy to convert back to decimal

## Base(ic) Practice
- The Java compiler has a fun quirk where every binary file is produces begins with

- What is this in decimal? octal? hexadecimal?

## Representation
- Sequences of bits have no intrinsic meaning!
	- Just the representations we assign to them by convention or by building certain operations into hardware
	- A 32-bit sequence represents an integer only because we have designed hardware to manipulate those sequences arithmetically: applying operations like addition, subtraction, etc
- By choosing an appropriate representation, you can use bits to represent any value you could imagine!
	- Characters represented by numeric character codes
	- Floating-point representations to support real numbers
	- Two-dimensional arrays of bits representing images
	- Sequences of images representing video, etc
- To be useful though, everyone needs to agree on a representation!

## Representation Pitfalls
::::::cols
::::col
```python
A = 1
B = 0
for i in range(10):
	B += 0.1
print(A == B)
```
::::
::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.25'}
- The left code will print out `False`!
- Python represents floating point (fractional) numbers using two integers
	- One to represent the significant digits
	- One to represent the exponent
::::
::::::
- $1\frac{1}{4}$ Example
	- In decimal:
		$\quad\displaystyle 1\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{2}{10} + \frac{5}{100} = 1.25 = (125, -2)$
	- In binary:
		$\quad\displaystyle 1\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.01 = (101, -10)$


## Floating Binary
:::incremental
- Say we wanted to convert the value $\tfrac{7}{8}$ to a binary floating point representation:
	$$\frac{7}{8} = \frac{0}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = 0.111 = (111, -11)$$
- Now how would we convert $\frac{1}{10}$ to binary??
	- We run into a problem! An infinitely repeating sequence!
	$$\frac{1}{10} = \frac{0}{1} + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{0}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{0}{64} + \frac{0}{128} + \frac{1}{256} +  \cdots = 0.0001100110011\ldots$$ 
	- Have to stop the sequence somewhere and approximate it:
		$$\frac{3}{32} = 0.09375\quad\text{or}\quad\frac{25}{256} = 0.09765625$$
:::

## Consequences
- The best we can do within the range of normal integers
	$$\frac{3602879701896397}{2^{55}} = 0.10000000000000000555111512312578270$$
- When doing operations on these numbers, extra decimals will sometimes get rounded off, suddenly making the number look precise, but you might always have a tiny bit of this rounding error showing up in floating point values.
- So be _careful_ using `==` for numeric comparisons! Rounding might result in unexpected falsehoods
	- Far better to check if two numbers are within a small margin of one another, or greater or less than the other
- Errors will usually average out over being a bit too large or two small
	- Repeated calculation of some types can sometimes accumulate errors in the same direction and cause more of an issue

## Representing Characters
- Use numeric encodings to represent character data inside the machine, where each character is assigned an integer value.
- Character codes are not very useful unless standardized though!
	- Competing encodings in the early years made it difficult to share data across machines
- First widely adopted character encoding was ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
- With only 256 possible characters, ASCII proved inadequate in the international world, and has therefore been superseded by Unicode.
