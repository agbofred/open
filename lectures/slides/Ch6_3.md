## Announcements
- Problem Set 2 has been posted!
- If you are still working on Project 1, get it in _pronto_!
- Sections today and tomorrow
- I have to be out of my office at 4:30pm today, so I apologize for cutting my office hours short today. I'll be around until at least 6 tomorrow to compensate
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)

## Review! {data-notes="Solution: t!d"}
What would be printed from the below piece of code here?
```python
s = "October is here already?!"
a = ""
for i in range(-4,4,3):
	a = s[i] + a
print(a)
```

:::{.poll}
#. `"yOo"`
#. `"dr esr"`
#. `"t!d"`
#. `"dy?!"`

## Slicing
- Often, you may want more than a single character
- Python allows you to specify a starting and an ending index through an operation known as _slicing_
- The syntax looks like:

	```python
	string_variable[start : limit]
	```
  where `start` is the first index to be included and everything up to but **not including** the `limit` is included
- `start` and `limit` are actually optional (but the `:` is not)
	- If `start` omitted, the slice will begin at the start of the string
	- If `limit` omitted, the slice will proceed to the end of the string


## and Dicing
- Can add a third component to the slice syntax, called a _stride_
```python
string_variable[start : limit : stride]
```
- Specifies how large the steps are between each included index
- Can also make the stride negative to proceed backwards through a string
```python-repl
>>> s = "spaghetti sauce"
>>> s[4:8]
hett
>>> s[10:]
sauce
>>> s[:10:2]
sahti
```

## Repeat again?
- We've already seen how we can use addition (`+`) in Python to concatenate strings
- In math, adding something many times is the same as multiplying

$$5+5+5+5+5+5 = 6 \times 5$$

- The same logic holds true for Python strings!
	- You multiply by a **integer**: the number of times you want the concatenation repeated
	- You can not multiply two strings together, Python will not understand what you are trying to do
```python
print("Betelguese, " * 3)
```

## Comparing Strings
- Python lets you use normal comparison operators to compare  strings

	```python
	string1 == string2
	```
	is true if `string1` and `string2` contain the same characters in the same order
- Comparisons involving greater than or less than are done similar to alphabetical ordering
	- Start at the beginning and compare a character. If they are the same, then compare the next character, etc
- All comparisons are done **according to their Unicode values**.
	- Called _lexicographic ordering_
	- `"cat" > "CAT"`
	- `"Zebra" < "aardvark"`


## Can't change a string's colors
- Strings are what we call _immutable_: they can not be modified in place by clients.
- You can "look" at different parts of the string, but you can not "change" those parts without making a whole new string
```{.python .badcode}
s = "Cats!"
s[0] = "R"   # THIS WILL ERROR!!
```
- You can of course create a new string object with the desired traits:
```python
s = "R" + s[1:]
```
- This applies to all methods that act on strings as well: they return a **new** string, they do not modify the original


## Methods to find string patterns

Method | Description
--- | -----
`string.find(pattern)` | Returns the first index of `pattern` in `string`, or `-1` if it does not appear
`string.find(pattern, k)` | Same as the one-argument version, but starts searching at index `k`
`string.rfind(pattern)` | Returns the last index of `pattern` is `string`, or `-1` if missing
`string.rfind(pattern, k)` | Same as the one-argument version, but searches backwards from index `k`
`string.startswith(prefix)` | Returns `True` if the string starts with `prefix`
`string.endswith(suffix)` | Returns `True` if the string ends with `suffix`


## Transforming Methods

Method | Description
---|----
`string.lower()` | Returns a copy of `string` with all letters converted to lowercase
`string.upper()` | Returns a copy of `string` with all letters converted to uppercase
`string.capitalize()` | Returns a copy of `string` with the first character capitalized and the rest lowercase
`string.strip()` | Returns a copy of `string` with whitespace and non-printing characters removed from both ends
`string.replace(old, new)` | Returns a copy of `string` with all instances of `old` replaced by `new`

## Classifying Character Methods

Method | Description
--- | -----
`char.isalpha()` | Returns `True` if `char` is a letter
`char.isdigit()` | Returns `True` if `char` is a digit
`char.isalnum()` | Returns `True` if `char` is letter or a digit
`char.islower()` | Returns `True` if `char` is a lowercase letter
`char.isupper()` | Returns `True` if `char` is an uppercase letter
`char.isspace()` | Returns `True` if `char` is a whitespace character (space, tab, or newline)
`char.isidentifier()` | Returns `True` if `char` is a legal Python identifier


## Igpay Atinlay
- Suppose we wanted to write a script that converted English to Pig Latin
- Rules of Pig Latin:
	- If the word begins with a consonant, move everything up to the first vowel to the end and append on "ay" at the end
	<center>
		`fleet` ⟶  `eetflay`
	</center>
	- If the word starts with a vowel, just append "way" to the end
	<center>
		`orange` ⟶  `orangeway`
	</center>
	- If the word has no vowels, do nothing
- Our decomposition:
	- Convert a single word
		- Find first vowel
	- Loop over whole phrase to convert the entire phrase word by word

## Indingfay Owelsvay
```python
def find_first_vowel_index(word):
	"""
	Find the first vowel in a word and return its index,
	or return None if no vowels found.
	"""
    for i in range(len(word)):
        index = "aeiou".find(word[i].lower())
        if index != -1:
            return i
    return None
```

## Onvertcay Oneway Ordway
```{.python style='max-height:900px;'}
def word_2_pig_latin(word):
	"""
	Convert a single word with no special characters from
	English to Pig Latin.
	"""
    vowel = find_first_vowel_index(word)
    if vowel is None:
        return word
    elif vowel == 0:
        return word + "way"
    else:
        return word[vowel:] + word[:vowel] + "ay"
```

## Onvertcay hrasepay
```{.python style='max-height:900px;'}
def string_2_pig_latin(string):
    start = 0
    i = 0
    phrase = ""
    finding_words = True
    while len(string) > 0 and finding_words:
        if not string[i].isalpha():
			word = string[start:i]
            phrase += word_2_pig_latin(word) + string[i]
            start = i + 1
        i += 1
        if i == len(string):
            finding_words = False
            phrase += word_2_pig_latin(string[start:])
    return phrase
```
