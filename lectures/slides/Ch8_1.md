## Announcements
- Project 5 guide posted!
	- Getting an earlier start is always recommended!
	- Section meetings this week will focus on common sticking points
- Final
	- I will be posting final study materials and some old tests next week so that you have material to study from
	- Will be more weighted toward content from the latter half of the semester, but everything we've been doing this semester builds on earlier material

## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: D[1][2]"}
After running the below code, how would you access the `"ninja"` element in list `D`?
```python
A = ['pirate', 'ninja']
B = ['samurai'] + A
C = [B, ['ship', 'rope', 'horse']]
D = C[::-1]
```


:::{.poll}
#. `D[1][0]`
#. `D[0][1]`
#. `D[0][2]`
#. `D[1][2]`

## Image Thresholding
::::::cols
::::col
- As an example of reading and manipulating pixel values, lets look at how we could threshold the image to the right
- Thresholding is when you take a grayscale image and convert it to a black and white image, where a pixel is set to be white if it is above a certain threshold in brightness
- Grayscale, so each RGB component is the same
- Let's threshold at a value of 30

## Thresholding Code
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:.8em;'}
from pgl import GWindow, GImage

def threshold(e):
    thresh_value = 30
    height = len(pixels)
    width = len(pixels[0])
    new_array = [[0 for i in range(width)] for i in range(height)]
    for r in range(height):
        for c in range(width):
            if GImage.get_red(pixels[r][c]) > thresh_value:
                new_array[r][c] = GImage.create_rgb_pixel(0, 255, 0)
            else:
                new_array[r][c] = GImage.create_rgb_pixel(0, 0, 0)
    new_image = GImage(new_array)
    gw.add(new_image)

gw = GWindow(800, 525)
image = GImage("Moon.png")
gw.add(image)
pixels = image.get_pixel_array()
gw.add_event_listener("click", threshold)
```

## Review Question!

::::cols
:::col
The two classes to the right mimic a bit of what might occur in the course of the Adventure Project. What python data type is `ANS`?

:::::poll
#. A String
#. An AdvObject
#. A Location
#. A List
:::::


:::
:::col


```{.python style='max-height:1000px; font-size:.6em;'}
class AdvObject:
	def __init__(self, name, loc):
		self.name = name
		self.loc = loc
	def get_loc(self):
		return self.loc

class Location:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
		self.stuff = []
	def store(self, item):
		self.stuff.append(item)
	def retrieve_top(self):
		return self.stuff.pop()

A = AdvObject("Hammer", "RA")
B = AdvObject("Torch", "RA")
RA = Location("RA")
RA.store(A)
RA.store(B)
ANS = RA.retrieve_top().get_loc()
```

## Searching for Efficiency
- Chapter 8 is less about introducing new programming machinery and more about better understanding what we already have
- Hopefully you have realized by now that there can be **many** approaches to solving a problem computationally
	- So far, the first way you figure out has likely been the "best", in that it gets the job done.
	- Sometimes there is a different though in an approach that is technically correct and one that is practically correct.
	- How can we make informed choices about the algorithms we use?
- Want to look at algorithm efficiency in this chapter
- Will focus mainly on Searching and Sorting as our examples to better understand how an algorithm's efficiency can be quantified


## A Linear Search
- Suppose you needed to determine if a particular element was in a list, and didn't have any of the built-in methods available to you
- The easiest method (which many of you have indeed used!) is to just search through the list element by element and check it to see if it is the one you desire
	- This approach is called a _linear search_
- Easy to understand and implement:
```python
def linear_search(quest, array):
	for i in range(len(array)):
		if array[i] == quest:
			return i
	return -1
```

## Searching for Area Codes
- To illustrate the efficiency of linear search, it can be helpful to work with a larger dataset
- We'll look here at searching through potential US area codes to find that of Salem: 503
- Linear search examines each value in order to find the matching value. 
	- As the arrays get larger, the number of steps required also grows
- As you watch linear search do its thing on the next slide, see if you can beat the computer at finding 503. 
	- What approach did you take?

## Linear Search in Action
<div class="fig-container" data-file="../images/d3/LinearSearch.html" data-style="width:100%; display:inline;" data-scroll="no"></div>


## How did you do?
- Frequently, many people can "beat the animation" in finding 503
- Approaches vary, but you may well have done something along the lines of:
	- Look at some number in the middle
	- Depending on how close it was to 503, jump ahead some in that direction and check again
- Requires some special conditions though, so let's try again

## Racing Linear Search Again
<div class="fig-container" data-file="../images/d3/LinearSearch_v2.html" data-style="width:100%; display:inline;" data-scroll="no"></div>

## Idea of a Binary Search
- If your data is ordered, then you might try a alternative search strategy
- Look at the center element in the array, it is either:
	- The value you want. Excellent! Return it.
	- A value larger than what you want. Throw away that value and everything bigger.
	- A value smaller than what you want. Throw away that value and everything smaller.
- Then you can repeat the process with the remaining elements until you find your value
- Since number of searched elements is divided by 2 each time, called a _binary search_


## Binary Search in Action
<div class="fig-container" data-file="../images/d3/BinarySearch.html" data-style="width:100%; display:inline;" data-scroll="no"></div>


## Implementing Binary Search
```{.python style="max-height:900px"}
def binary_search(target, array):
	lh = 0
	rh = len(array) - 1
	while lh <= rh:
		middle = (lh + rh) // 2
		if array[middle] == target:
			return middle
		elif array[middle] < target:
			lh = middle + 1
		else:
			rh = middle - 1
	return -1
```

## Linear Search Efficiency
- The running time of the linear seach depends on the size of the array
	- That in itself is not really surprising. The running time of most algorithms will depend on the size of the problem to which the algorithm is applied.
- For many applications, it is easy to come up with a numeric value that describes the problem size, commonly called $N$.
	- For most lists, $N$ is simply the length of the array
- In the worst case, when the target value is the last element of the list or does not appear at all, the linear search requires $N$ steps
	- On average, it takes about half that, or $\frac{N}{2}$
	- Computer Scientists are apparently pessimists though, and will generally use the worse case scenario to compare


## Binary Search Efficiency
- The running time of binary search also depends on the size of the array, but in a very different way
- Each step of the process, the binary search rules out half the remaining options
	- The worst case (which we had earlier!) requires a number of steps equal to however many times we can divide the array in half until we have only a single number left.
	- Mathematically, this looks like
		$$1 = N / \underbrace{2 / 2 / 2 / 2 \cdots / 2}_{k\text{ times}} = \frac{N}{2^k}$$
- We really want to know the number of steps, $k$, so solving for $k$:
$$2^k = N \quad\Rightarrow\quad k = \log_2(N)$$


## Comparing Efficiencies
- The below table illustrates the differences in the number of required steps for the two search algorithms

Problem Size | Linear ($N$) | Binary ($log_2 N$)
--- | --- | ---
10 | 10 | 3
100 | 100 | 7
1,000 | 1,000 | 10
1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 20
1,000,000,000 | 1,000,000,000 | 30

- Clearly, for large values, the difference in the number of steps is **enormous**
- At 1 million elements, the binary search is 50,000 times faster!

## Sorting
- Binary search only works on arrays in which the elements are ordered.
	- The process of putting the elements into order is called _sorting_.
- Lots of different sorting algorithms, which can vary substantially in their efficiency.
- From an algorithms view, sorting is probably the most applicable algorithm we'll discuss in this course
	- Organizing data makes it easier to digest that data, whether the data is being digested by other machines or by humans
