## Announcements
- Hopefully you are making some progress on Problem Set 4!
- I **am** still making progress with grading PS's, though I'm behind more than I'd like, for which I apologize.
- Lab today as per usual!
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)

## Review!{data-notes="Solution: x[-6:-1]"}
Suppose you have the string `x = "consternation"` and you'd like to just extract and print the word `"nation"`. Which expression below will **not** give you the string `"nation"`?


:::{.poll}
#. `x[7:len(x)]`
#. `x[7:]`
#. `x[-6:len(x)]`
#. `x[-6:-1]`

## Igpay Atinlay
- Reminder: we were trying to construct a program to convert English to Pig Latin
- Rules of Pig Latin:
	- If the word begins with a consonant, move everything up to the first vowel to the end and append on "ay" at the end
	<center>
		`fleet` ⟶  `eetflay`
	</center>
	- If the word starts with a vowel, just append "way" to the end
	<center>
		`orange` ⟶  `orangeway`
	</center>
	- If the word has no vowels, do nothing
- Our decomposition:
	- Convert a single word ✓
		- Find first vowel ✓
	- Loop over whole phrase to convert the entire phrase word by word

## oNvertcay hrasepay
```{.python style='max-height:900px;'}
def string_2_pig_latin(string):
    start = 0
    i = 0
    phrase = ""
    finding_words = True
    while len(string) > 0 and finding_words:
        if not string[i].isalpha():
			word = string[start:i]
            phrase += word_2_pig_latin(word) + string[i]
            start = i + 1
        i += 1
        if i == len(string):
            finding_words = False
            phrase += word_2_pig_latin(string[start:])
    return phrase
```


## The `english.py` Library
- To facilitate working with English words, we can take advantage of the pre-written `english` module
	- This will be highly useful in the Project 2
- The `english` module exports two resources:
	- `ENGLISH_WORDS`: a constant which contains all the valid English words in alphabetical order
	- `is_english_word()`: a predicate function which takes a string as input and returns `True` or `False` depending on if that string is in the list of valid English words

<!--
## Biggest simple palindrome
- Suppose we wanted to determine what the longest simple palindrome(s) was in the English language:

```python
from english import ENGLISH_WORDS

def find_biggest_palindromes():
    best_length = 0
    for word in ENGLISH_WORDS:
        if word == word[::-1] and len(word) >= best_length:
            print(word)
            best_length = len(word)
```
-->

## Biggest No-vowel Word
- Suppose we wanted to determine the longest word in the English language without vowels:

```python
from english import ENGLISH_WORDS

def find_first_vowel(word):
    for i in range(len(word)):
        if word[i].lower() in "aeiou":
            return i
    return -1

def find_longest_no_vowels():
    best_length = 0
    for word in ENGLISH_WORDS:
        vowel_loc = find_first_vowel(word)
        if vowel_loc == -1 and len(word) > best_length:
            best_length = len(word)
            print(word)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    find_longest_no_vowels()
```

## When Pig Latin = English?
- What about when the Pig Latin version of a word is a (different) but valid English word?
- Lets not count words with no vowels, since clearly they would qualify
```python
def platin_equals_english():
    count = 0
    for word in ENGLISH_WORDS:
        platin = word_2_pig_latin(word)
        if is_english_word(platin) and word != platin:
            print(word, ":", platin)
            count += 1
    return count
```


## String Formatting
- Constructing text or a sentence by interleaving strings and other objects comes up a lot in communicating code results to a user
```python
A = 10
B = print("The value of A is: " + str(A) +"!")
print(B)
```
- Having to convert everything manually to strings (when necessary) and concatenate it all together is clunky and easy to mess up
- Python gives us two main methods to assist with this and any other formatting desires we might have:
	- The `.format()` method in Python's string class
	- A new language feature called _f-strings_, introduced in Python 3.6


## Placeholders
- The `format` method and f-strings rely on the idea of a _placeholder_ that is inserted into the string, and that marks where later data should be inserted
	- We use curly brackets: `{}` to indicate the placeholder
	- The placeholder shows up in the original string that the `format` method is acting on, not as an argument to `format`
- Objects which are provided as arguments to `format` are then converted to a string if needed and swapped in instead of the placeholder.
- Simple Examples
	- `"The value of A is {}".format(10)`
	- `"{} + {} is {}".format(2, 5, 2+5)`


## Labels can be key
- By default, all arguments to `.format()` are positional
	- Order of parameters is matched with the order of `{}`
- You can also provide an order index inside the placeholder (`{ }`)
	- `"{1} + {0} is {2}".format(2, 5, 2+5)`
- You can also provide keyword labels in the placeholder, but then you must call with a keyword
	- `"{name} is {age} years old.".format(age=34, name="Amy")`
	- `"{} + {B} + {C} = {}".format(3, 10, C=5, B=2)`

## The format of format
- Often times when displaying a value in a string, we may want control over certain format specifications:
	- The number of decimals shown
	- Padding a number of zeros or spaces
	- Justifying a number within a region of characters
	- Use scientific notation
	- etc
- We can do all this (and more) by including a colon and then a special format specification inside the placeholder!
	- `"The value of A is {0:.5f}".format(10)`


## Shaping your format
- Lots we can do, but we rarely need to do it all at once
- The basic building blocks:
<center>
<span style="font-family: monospace">
<span class="fragment highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index=6>[[fill]align]</span><!--
--><span class="fragment highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index=5>[sign]</span><!--
--><span class="fragment highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index=4>[width]</span><!--
--><span class="fragment highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index=3>[,]</span><!--
--><span class="fragment highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index=2>[.precision]</span><!--
--><span class="fragment highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index=1>[type]</span>
</span>
</center>

<br>
<hr>

<div class="only-fragment fragment current" data-fragment-index=1>
- `type`{.no-highlight}
	- What type of object you want to represent as a string
	- "d" - base-10 integer
	- "f" - float or decimal
	- "e" - scientific notation
	- More on next slide
</div>
<div class="only-fragment fragment current" data-fragment-index=2>
- `precision`{.no-highlight}
	- How many digits to display after a decimal point
	- Details can vary a little by conversion type
</div>
<div class="only-fragment fragment current" data-fragment-index=3>
- `Grouping`{.no-highlight}
	- A comma here indicates that numbers should be grouped in sets of 3 and separated with a comma
</div>
<div class="only-fragment fragment current" data-fragment-index=4>
- `width`{.no-highlight}
	- The minimum number of characters you want the formatted value to be
</div>
<div class="only-fragment fragment current" data-fragment-index=5>
- `sign`{.no-highlight}
	- If the sign of the number should be specified
	- A + sign ensures all numbers will have either a + or - sign
	- A space just adds a space before positive numbers (negatives would have a - sign in front)
</div>
<div class="only-fragment fragment current" data-fragment-index=6>
- `[fill]align`{.no-highlight}
	- How you want the text aligned if it is smaller than the minium
		- Can be `<`, `>`, or `^` for left, right, or center justified
	- Any characters you want to fill the empty space
		- Default is space
</div>


## Output Conversion Types
- Below is a table of most common conversion types:

:::{style="font-size:0.8em"}

Code | Description
--- | ---
`b` | Inserts an integer using its binary representation
`d` | Inserts an integer using its decimal representation
`e` or `E` | Inserts a number using scientific notation
`f` or `F` | Inserts a number using a decimal point format
`g` or `G` | Choose `e` or `f` to get the best fit
`o` | Inserts an integer using its octal representation
`s` | Inserts a string value
`x` or `X` | Inserts an integer using its hexadecimal representation

:::
- Uppercase conversion types use capital characters where possible in output


## Not to be confused with a g-string
- Short for "format string", an f-string achieves the same thing as `.format()` but with less syntax
- Moves the value to be substituted directly into the placehold itself
- Need an `f` right before the string to let Python know it needs to do more with this particular string
```python
A = 10
B = 15.123234
print(f"A is {A} and B is {B:0.2f}")
```
- You can otherwise use the same syntax and format specs as with format!
