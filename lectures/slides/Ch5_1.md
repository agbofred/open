## Review Question! {data-notes="Answer is 27"}

::::::cols
::::col
What would be the printed value of z at the end of the code to the right?

:::{.poll}
#. 19
#. 25
#. 27
#. None of the above
:::

::::

::::col
```python
def f(x,y=0):
	z = (x + 3) ** 2
	return y + z

x = 1
z = x + f(y=x,x=2)
print(z)

```

## Name Resolution and Scope
- When Python encounters a variable name in a program, it looks for where the variable was defined in an expanding search:
	1. **Local** - The local context is all the variables defined within the current function. This includes variables appearing as a parameter!
	2. **Enclosing** - The enclosing context consists of the names defined in a function enclosing the current one.
	3. **Global** - The global context consists of names defined outside of any function or imported into the current module.
	4. **Built-in** - The last place Python looks is in the names of any built-in functions, like `abs`, `str`, `print`, etc.
- The part of a program in which a name is defined in called its _scope_

## Scoping Example
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
def func1(x,y):
	return z + func2(x,y)

def func2(x,y):
	def func3(x):
		return (y + x) ** 2

	z = x - func3(y)
	return z - y

z = 1
print(func1(2,z))
```

## Local Variables
- In Python, assigning any value to a variable means that the variable is assumed to be _local_
	- This generally makes sense, as you would not want more specific functions overriding variables in other areas
- Can lead to issues though:
```{.python .badcode}
def increment():
	x = x + 1

x = 0
increment()
```
- There are a few ways to address this, but we'll focus on one in particular when it comes to PGL


## Understanding Check {data-notes="Answer is 50"}
::::cols
:::col
What would be the final printed value of `c` in the code to the right?

:::::poll
#. -15
#. 20
#. 50
#. None of the above
:::::

:::
:::col
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
def f(a, b=5, c=True):
	if c:
		return a + b
	else:
		return a * b

def g(c):
	for i in range(2):
		c+=b
	return c > b

a = -3
b = 2
c = f(10, c=g(a))
print(c)
```

## Libraries and Interfaces
::::cols
:::{.col style="flex-grow:1.5"}
- Modern programming depends on the use of libraries. 
	- You usually write only a fraction of the code.
- Libraries can be viewed from two perspectives:
	- Code that uses a library is called a _client_.
	- Code for the library itself is called the _implementation_
- The point where the client and the implementation meet is called the _interface_
	- Serves as both a barrier and a communication channel

## Nondeterministic Programming
- Before writing our own library, helps to have more examples than just `math`
- Let's look at the built-in `random` library, which lets us simulate random processes
- Programs that involve random processes that cannot be predicted in advance are said to be _nondeterministic_
- Nondeterministic behavior is essential to many applications. 
	- Many games would not be enjoyable if they behaved the exact same way every playthrough
	- Important practical uses in simulations, computer security, and algorithm research

## Random Examples
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
import random

def random_redblue():
	if random.random() > 0.5:
		return "red"
	else:
		return "blue"

def random_color():
	color_string = "#"
	for i in range(6):
		color_string += random.choice("0123456789ABCDEF")
	return color
```

## Quite the Reader
- You can `return` any type of variable from a function, including `GObject` graphical objects
- Can be useful to write simple functions that bundle together common tasks
- Can create our own Python library by constructing a collection of constants or functions
- All code not in functions gets executed as soon as we `import` so generally don't want extraneous print statements or to be running any code directly
- Want the library to be in the same location as any code we want to `import` the library in


## PGL Help Library
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:0.75em;'}
from pgl import GRect, GLabel
import random

def create_filled_rect(
	x_cent, y_cent, width, height, fill_col='black', border_col=None
):
	"""
	Creates a GRect object with the desired fill color. 
	If a border color is specified, also draws the 
	border in the desired color.
	"""
	rect = GRect(x_cent-width/2, 
				 y_cent-height/2, 
				 width, height)
	rect.set_filled(True)
	if border_col is None:
		rect.set_color(fill_col)
	else:
		rect.set_color(border_col)
		rect.set_fill_color(fill_col)
	return rect

def random_color():
	"""
	Returns a random opaque color as a hex string.
	"""
	color = "#"
	for i in range(6):
		color += random.choice("0123456789ABCDEF")
	return color

def create_centered_label(x_cent, y_cent, text, font=None):
	"""
	Creates a GLabel object and centers it on the coordinates
	x_cent and y_cent.
	"""
	label = GLabel(text)
	if font is not None:
		label.set_font(font)
	label.set_location(x_cent - label.get_width() / 2, 
					   y_cent + label.get_ascent() / 2 )
	return label
```

## New Methods
- A new method that acts on a `GWindow`:

 |
:---|:----
`get_element_at(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns the frontmost object at (x,y) or `None`

- And more new methods that act on any `GObject`

 | 
:---|:---------
`set_location(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Resets the location of the object to the specified point
`move(dx,dy)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dx` and `dy` pixels from its current position
`move_polar(dr,theta)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dr` pixel units in direction `theta`
`contains(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns `True` if the object contains the specified point
`get_color()`{.no-highlight} | Returns the color currently assigned to the object


## The Python Event Model
- Graphical applications usually make it possible for the user to control the action of a program by using an input device such a mouse.
	- Programs supporting this type of control are called _interactive programs_.
- User actions such as clicking the mouse are called _events_.
- Programs that respond to events are said to be _event driven_.
- User input does not generally occur at predictable times. As the events are not controlled by the program, they are said to be _asynchronous_.
- In Python, you write a function that acts as a _listener_ for a particular event type. When the event happens, the listener is called.


## First Class Functions
- Functions in Python are treated as data values just like anything else!
	- We will need to take advantage of this to write listener functions.
- You can assign a function to a variable, pass it as a parameter, return it as a result, etc
- Functions treated like any other data value are called _first-class functions_
- To work with a function itself, you leave off the `()`. Including the parentheses is how you _call_ the function!


## A First Class Example
```python
import math

def evaluate_numbers(func):
	print(func)
	print(func(0))
	print(func(2))
	print(func(10))

evaluate_numbers(math.sqrt)
evaluate_numbers(math.exp)
```

<!--
## Inner Functions
- Python allows you to define one function inside another:
```python
def f(x, y):
	def g(n):
		return x ** n
	y += g(x)
	return y
```
- It is worth looking at an example with our stack frames to see what is fully happening here


## Name Resolution and Scope

	1. **Local** - The local context is all the variables defined within the current function. This includes variables appearing as a parameter!

- `f2` must also keep track of any local variables!
- The local variables that are included as part of a function are called its _closure_
