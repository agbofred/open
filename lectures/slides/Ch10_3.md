## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: hnktge"}
::::::cols
::::col
Let's consider a greatly simplified Enigma machine, which only has one rotor that is not turning. So the signal goes through the rotor then the reflector and back through the rotor. Given the rotor and reflector mappings shown to the right, what would the word `python` encrypt to?

## Overusing Inheritance
- Inheritance is often used in situations where it does not really apply
	- A common example you might see in textbooks is a `Pizza` class with various subclasses of pizza, like Pepperoni or Hawaiian.
	- This is silly, there is only one point of difference between those objects: the ingredients
		- Just make a pizza class with a list of ingredients as an attribute
- Inheritance makes sense when subclasses share behavior


## Extensions
- While designing new class hierarchies will prove useful as you move on to larger applications, it is often more useful to **extend** existing classes to add new, desirable behavior
- This can be done with any existing class, but a few classes in the `GObject` hierarchy make very enticing targets as the bases for potential extension:
	- The `GPolygon` class makes it easy to define new subclasses that have a polygonal outline.
		- Also automatically support filling, since `GPolygon` is a subclass of `GFillableObject`
	- The `GCompound` class can serve as a great parent for new subclasses that are composed of a combination of other shapes.
- In either case, it is generally useful to add additional methods or attributes to the subclass that are specific to that type.

## A Starry Example
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:0.8em;'}
class Star(GPolygon):
    """ Class to draw an any-sided star with specified insets. """

    def __init__(self, n_pts, r_out, r_in):
        GPolygon.__init__(self)
        angle_step = 2*math.pi / n_pts
        angle = -math.pi/2
        for n in range(n_pts):
            self.add_vertex(r_out * math.cos(angle), 
                            r_out * math.sin(angle))
            angle += angle_step / 2
            self.add_vertex(r_in * math.cos(angle),
                            r_in * math.sin(angle))
            angle += angle_step / 2


def draw_stars():
    gw = GWindow(400, 400)
    s = Star(7, 100, 50)
    s.set_filled(True)
    s.set_fill_color('Gold')
    gw.add(s, 200, 200)

    s = Star(23, 40,30)
    s.set_filled(True)
    s.set_fill_color('Red')
    gw.add(s, 200,200)

draw_stars()
```

## Now for something a bit flashier!
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
class FlashingStar(Star):
    """ Class to draw flashing stars! """

    def __init__(self, n_pts, r_out, r_in, 
				 colors=['red','blue'], state=True):
        Star.__init__(self, n_pts, r_out, r_in)
        self.state = state
        self.set_filled(self.state)
        self.set_fill_color(random.choice(colors))
        

    def swap_fill(self):
		self.state = not self.state
        self.set_filled(self.state)


def draw_stars():
    def flash_callback():
        for star in starlist:
            star.swap_fill()

    gw = GWindow(400, 400)
    starlist = []
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            star = FlashingStar(3+i+j, 50, 20,
				state=random.choice([True,False]))
            gw.add(star, 100+i*100, 100+j*100)
            starlist.append(star)
    gw.set_interval(flash_callback, 1000)

draw_stars()
```

## Making Fancy Labels
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
class FancyLabel(GCompound):
    """ Class to create a label in a nice filled box """

    FONT = "24px 'Arial', 'Sans-Serif'"

    def __init__(self, text, tcolor='black', bcolor='red'):
        GCompound.__init__(self)
        label = GLabel(text)
        label.set_font(FancyLabel.FONT)
        label.set_color(tcolor)
        lwidth = label.get_width()+20
        lheight = label.get_height()+10
        label.move(
                -label.get_width() / 2,
                label.get_ascent()/2
                )
        background = GRect(
				-lwidth/2, -lheight/2, 
				lwidth, lheight
				)
        background.set_filled(True)
        background.set_color(bcolor)

        self.add(background)
        self.add(label)




def draw_label():
    gw = GWindow(400,400)
    flabel = FancyLabel('Cool label!')
    flabel2 = FancyLabel('SUPER cool...', "yellow", "green")
    gw.add(flabel, 200, 200)
    gw.add(flabel2, 300,300)

draw_label()
```

## Graphical Object Decomposition
- Using the `GCompound` class as a parent class makes it possible to apply the strategy of decomposition to graphical objects!
	- Can decompose a graphical display into successively simpler pieces
- The text illustrates this with a train diagram, I will illustrate it here by making a segmented snake.
<br><br>

![\ ](../images/CompoundSnake.png){width=40%}


## The Snake Hierarchy
- Here I will utilize a generic snake body segment which will be a subclass of `GCompound`
	- The snake head and tail segments will then be subclasses of the body segment class
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=60%
[
every node/.style = {draw, very thick, rounded corners, MGreen, inner sep=10pt, font=\Large\tt},
]
\node (GC) at (0,0) {GCompound};
\node[right=2cm of GC] (Seg) {Segment};
\draw[very thick, MOrange, -stealth] (Seg) -- (GC);
\node[above right=0.5cm and 2cm of Seg] (Head) {Head};
\node[below right=0.5cm and 2cm of Seg] (Tail) {Tail};
\path[very thick, MOrange, -stealth] (Head) edge (Seg) (Tail) edge (Seg);
\end{tikzpicture}


- All the common elements will be added in the body segment, with the head and tail subclasses only adding their specific details.

## Nesting Snakes
- Since a `GCompound` is also a `GObject`, you can go ahead and add a `GCompound` to another `GCompound`
- Here I will add all the snake pieces to a new class `Snake`, which is a subclass of `GCompound`
- One advantage of doing so is that we can then animate the entire snake as a whole easily!

        body = GOval(-Segment.R, -Segment.R, 
					 2*Segment.R, 2*Segment.R)
        body.set_filled(True)
        body.set_fill_color('green')
        body.set_line_width(5)
        self.add(body)

class Tail(Segment):

        self.add(Head(), (length-1)*Segment.R, 0)

## Variable Types
- So far we have been looking at _instance variables_
	- An attribute that is associated to a single particular instance or object
	- Frequently, this is what we want when working with an object-oriented mindset
- Sometimes though, it is useful to create an attribute that is tied directly to the class itself, and not to a specific object.
	- Called a _class variable_

## Creating class variables
- No usage of `self`, since this variable applies to all the objects!
- Otherwise defined just like you would normally define a variable, but appears at the top of the class definition, immediately after the header line

```python
class MyBestClass:
	a_class_variable = "hello!"

	def __init__(self):
		self.an_instance_variable = "hi!"
```

## Accessing Class Variables
- You access a class variable by directly referencing the class name:
	- `print(MyBestClass.a_class_variable)`
	- You don't actually have needed to make an object of that type yet to access
- You can access directly from the object as well, but I'd recommend against it, as it leads to easier confusing between class and instance variables.
- Changing the class variable should also be done by referencing the class name
	- `MyBestClass.a_class_variable = "HELLO"`

## When to use
- Do all members or objects of your class share a common trait?
	- Would it make sense for a single member of that class to have that trait altered?
	- If no, it might be a good candidate for a class varible.
- Are there specific constants or known values that all instances of your class will rely on?
	- The math library has `math.pi` for instance as a class variable.
- Do you need some sort of global counter to keep track of the number of instances of a type you have created?

## Method Types
- We have also been looking at _instance methods_ so far
	- Each method is tied to a particular object that it will act on
- There are class methods, but we won't see or spend time with those
- An alternative type of method are called _static methods_
	- Static methods are **not** tied to a particular object
	- They do **not** have self as the first parameter
	- Makes them very similar to just a normal function
	- Only in the class because they are related to everything else

## Creating Static Methods
- Create a static method using what is called a _decorator_ in Python
- You can imagine that decorators are special flags to Python that it should treat a particular method in a certain fashion.
- Decorators come immediately **before** the method header line, and start with the `@` symbol

```python
class MyNewClass:
	
	@staticmethod
	def my_method(not_self_1, not_self_2):
		print(not_self_1, not_self_2)
```

## Calling Static Methods
- Because the method is not attached to an object, you should not call it with the receiver dot syntax
- Must call them using the functional syntax, beginning with the class name
	- `MyNewClass.my_method(1,2)`
- Frequently used for functions that are related to the class but could otherwise be independent of the class
	- Examples: `GImage.get_red(pixel)` and `GImage.create_rgb_pixel(a,r,g,b)`
