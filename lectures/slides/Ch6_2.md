## Representation
- Sequences of bits have no intrinsic meaning!
	- Just the representations we assign to them by convention or by building certain operations into hardware
	- A 32-bit sequence represents an integer only because we have designed hardware to manipulate those sequences arithmetically: applying operations like addition, subtraction, etc
- By choosing an appropriate representation, you can use bits to represent any value you could imagine!
	- Characters represented by numeric character codes
	- Floating-point representations to support real numbers
	- Two-dimensional arrays of bits representing images
	- Sequences of images representing video, etc
- To be useful though, everyone needs to agree on a representation!

## Representation Pitfalls
::::::cols
::::col
```python
A = 1
B = 0
for i in range(10):
	B += 0.1
print(A == B)
```
::::
::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.25'}
- The left code will print out `False`!
- Python represents floating point (fractional) numbers using two integers
	- One to represent the significant digits
	- One to represent the exponent
::::
::::::
- $1\frac{1}{4}$ Example
	- In decimal:
		$\quad\displaystyle 1\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{2}{10} + \frac{5}{100} = 1.25 = (125, -2)$
	- In binary:
		$\quad\displaystyle 1\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.01 = (101, -10)$


## Floating Binary
:::incremental
- Say we wanted to convert the value $\tfrac{7}{8}$ to a binary floating point representation:
	$$\frac{7}{8} = \frac{0}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = 0.111 = (111, -11)$$
- Now how would we convert $\frac{1}{10}$ to binary??
	- We run into a problem! An infinitely repeating sequence!
	$$\frac{1}{10} = \frac{0}{1} + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{0}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{0}{64} + \frac{0}{128} + \frac{1}{256} +  \cdots = 0.0001100110011\ldots$$ 
	- Have to stop the sequence somewhere and approximate it:
		$$\frac{3}{32} = 0.09375\quad\text{or}\quad\frac{25}{256} = 0.09765625$$
- Note that we have the same issues in decimal, writing out ratios like $\frac{1}{3}$
:::

## Consequences
- Most languages end up taking the first 53 significant digits
	$$\frac{3602879701896397}{2^{55}} = 0.10000000000000000555111512312578270$$
- When doing operations on these numbers, extra decimals will sometimes get rounded off, suddenly making the number look precise, but you might always have a tiny bit of this rounding error showing up in floating point values.
- So be _careful_ using `==` for numeric comparisons! Rounding might result in unexpected falsehoods
	- Far better to check if two numbers are within a small margin of one another, or greater or less than the other
- Errors will usually average out over being a bit too large or two small
	- Repeated calculation of some types can sometimes accumulate errors in the same direction and cause more of an issue

## Representing Characters
- Use numeric encodings to represent character data inside the machine, where each character is assigned an integer value.
- Character codes are not very useful unless standardized though!
	- Competing encodings in the early years made it difficult to share data across machines
- First widely adopted character encoding was ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
- Originally just with 128 possible characters, even after expanding to 256, ASCII proved inadequate in the international world, and has therefore been superseded by Unicode.

## ASCII

![The ASCII subset of Unicode](../images/ASCII.svg){width=100%}


## Meeting `chr` and `ord`
- Python includes two build in functions to simplify conversion between an integer and the corresponding Unicode character
- `chr` takes a base-10 integer and returns the corresponding Unicode character as a string
	- `chr(65)` gives `"A"` (capital A)
	- `chr(960)` gives `"π"` (Greek letter pi)
- `ord` goes the other direction, taking a single character string and returning the corresponding base-10 integer of that character in Unicode
	- `ord("B")` gives 66
	- `ord(" ")` gives 32
	- `ord("π")` gives 960

## Abstract Strings
- Characters (and their Unicode representation) are most often used in programming when combined to make collections of consecutive characters called _strings_.
- Internally, strings are stored as a sequence of characters in a sequential chunk of memory.
- You don't have to (and generally don't want to) think of the internal representation.
	- Better to think of the string as a single abstract unit
- Python emphasizes this abstract view by defining a built-in string class that already defines a selection of higher-level operations on string objects

## Picking Characters
- A string is an _ordered_ collection of characters
	- Character positions in the string are identified by an _index_, which **starts at 0**

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=70%
[
block/.style={draw, thick, MGreen, font=\tt\Large, minimum size=1cm}
]
\foreach[count=\i from 0] \x in {s,p,a,g,h,e,t,t,i, ,s,a,u,c,e}{
	\node[block, baseline=0](char) at (\i, 0) {$\strut$\x};
	\node[below=0cm of char, MBlue,anchor=north, font=\large] {\i};
}
\end{tikzpicture}

- You can select individual characters from the string using the syntax

	```python
	string[k]
	```

	where `string` is the variable assigned to the desired string and `k` is the index integer of the character you want
```python-repl
>>> s = "spaghetti sauce"
>>> print(s[5])
e
```

## Back it Up
- Sometimes it is more useful to count from the end of the string, not the beginning
- Python gives you a convenient way to do this, using negative indexes

<br>

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=70%
[
block/.style={draw, thick, MGreen, font=\tt\Large, minimum size=1cm}
]
\foreach[count=\x from 0, evaluate=\x as \i using {int(15-\x)}] \s in {s,p,a,g,h,e,t,t,i, ,s,a,u,c,e}{
	\node[block,baseline=0](char) at (\x, 0) {$\strut$\s};
	\node[below=0cm of char, MBlue,anchor=north, font=\large] {-\i};
}
\end{tikzpicture}

- A common use case is to grab the last character of the string, using

	```python
	s[-1]
	```
	which is shorthand for

	```python
	s[len(s)-1]
	```

## Slicing
- Often, you may want more than a single character
- Python allows you to specify a starting and an ending index through an operation known as _slicing_
- The syntax looks like:

	```python
	string_variable[start : limit]
	```
  where `start` is the first index to be included and everything up to but **not including** the `limit` is included
- `start` and `limit` are actually optional (but the `:` is not)
	- If `start` omitted, the slice will begin at the start of the string
	- If `limit` omitted, the slice will proceed to the end of the string


## and Dicing
- Can add a third component to the slice syntax, called a _stride_
```python
string_variable[start : limit : stride]
```
- Specifies how large the steps are between each included index
- Can also make the stride negative to proceed backwards through a string
```python-repl
>>> s = "spaghetti sauce"
>>> s[4:8]
hett
>>> s[10:]
sauce
>>> s[:10:2]
sahti
```
