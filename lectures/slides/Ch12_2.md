## Announcements
- Elise won the Graphics Contest with her faithful recreation of the Blues Clues backdrop!
	- Other entries will be entered into a drawing at the end of the semester for a free 25% boost to any exam (up to 100%)
- The Game Contest rules will be posted on website today if you want to start on that over next week.
- Sections today and tomorrow are geared toward dictionaries and the classes
- We will talk about sets on Friday
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)

## Review Question
::::::cols
::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.5;'}
Suppose I had created the data structure to the right in order to keep track of class sizes over the years. How would I access the size of my Spring 2018 Mechanics (Phys 339) class?
<br><br>

:::{.poll}
#. `data[2018]['classes']['Phys339']`
#. `data[1]['Phys339']`
#. `data[1]['classes']['Phys339']`
#. `data[2018]['Phys339']`

<!--
## File I/O
- Frequently want to be able to read in or write data to files in a smooth way to preserve these data structures
- A variety of ways this can be done
	- XML, TOML, JSON
- JSON is particularly interesting to us, because its syntax almost exactly matches Python's (even though it was made for Javascript)
- Python has a built in library to read and write JSON files
	- `json.load(file)`
		- Loads the JSON data structure from the specified file into its Python equivalent
	- `json.dump(object, file)`
		- Writes a JSON text representation of the object to the given file
	- Both methods are used inside our normal `with open() as fhandle:` syntax
-->

## Class Method Types
- When creating classes, we have been looking at _instance methods_ so far
	- Each method is tied to a particular object that it will act on
- There are class methods, but we won't see or spend time with those
- An alternative type of method are called _static methods_
	- Static methods are **not** tied to a particular object
	- They do **not** have self as the first parameter
	- Makes them very similar to just a normal function
	- Only in the class because they are related to everything else

## Creating Static Methods
- Create a static method using what is called a _decorator_ in Python
- You can imagine that decorators are special flags to Python that it should treat a particular method in a certain fashion.
- Decorators come immediately **before** the method header line, and start with the `@` symbol

```python
class MyNewClass:
	
	@staticmethod
	def my_method(not_self_1, not_self_2):
		print(not_self_1, not_self_2)
```

## Calling Static Methods
- Because the method is not attached to an object, you should not call it with the receiver dot syntax
- Must call them using the functional syntax, beginning with the class name
	- `MyNewClass.my_method(1,2)`
- Frequently used for functions that are related to the class but could otherwise be independent of the class
	- Examples: `GImage.get_red(pixel)` and `GImage.create_rgb_pixel(a,r,g,b)`

## Data-Driven Programs
- In most programming languages, data structures are easier to manipulate than the code itself
- Often useful then to push as much of the program behavior as possible into data structures rather than methods and functions
	- Programs working in this fashion are said to be _data driven_
- In a data-driven model, the actual program (commonly called the _driver_) is generally very small and simple simple managing:
	- Reading in data from a file into a suitable internal structure
	- Using the data structure to control the flow of the program

## The Teaching Machine
- Suppose you wanted to write a program that would give an "intelligent" quiz
	- Correct answers would move the client on to other, more difficult questions
	- Incorrect answers might give some explanation and then ask some follow up questions
- Having the questions and answers in some sort of data structure would make sense
- The teacher would generally be who comes up with the questions and progression though, and most teachers are not experts at writing code
	- Need a format that is more not code based where teachers could construct the questions and progression
	- Need to translate that format into more common data structures that the computer can then understand and act on

## The Course Data File
- One common method of achieving this is to have configuration or data files
- The general format of a file is shown to the left, and an example question to the right

## Teaching the Adventure
- The TeachingMachine program can process and run _any_ data file that has the correct format
	- Does not need to technically be a series of educational questions
	- This is part of the strength of the data driven model: data is easy to change, programs less so
- Could make a sort of "Choose your own adventure" game out of it!

## Life among Wizards
- The history of the early internet has been told in several books. One relates the following story:

> A small circle of friends at BBN had gotten hooked on Dungeons and Dragons, an elaborate fantasy role-playing game in which one player invents a setting and populates it with monsters and puzzles, and the other players then make their way through that setting. The game exists only in the minds of the players.
>
> Dave Walden got his introduction to the game one night when Eric Roberts, a student from a class he was teaching at Harvard, took him to a D&D session. Walden immediately rounded up a group of friends from the ARPANET team for continued sessions. Roberts created the Mirkwood Tales.
>
> One of the regulars was Will Crowther.

## The Age of the Slow Machine
<video class='stretch' data-autoplay loop src="../video/Adventure_SlowMachine.webm"></video>

## A Brief History of Adventure
- Eric Roberts begins the Mirkwood Tales in early 1975
- Will Crowther creates Adventure later that year
- Will moves to Xerox/PARC in 1976
- Stanford graduate student Don Woods released an expanded version of Adventure in early 1977
- Dave Lebling and others from MIT release the first version of Zork in 1977
	- Game later becomes the foundation of the computer game company Infocom
- Adventure is ported to wide variety of platforms by 1980
- Eric Roberts creates an expanded version in 1984 and uses it as the basis for his first Adventure Project/Contest at Wellesley

## Adventure Classes
![\ ](../images/AdventureClasses.svg)


## Milestone 1
- Adapt the code from the Teaching Machine application so that it uses the class and method names for Adventure
- Once you finish this milestone, you should be able to wander around a bit in the game

## Milestone 2
- Implement `set_visited` and `has_been_visited` to keep track of which rooms have been visited.
- Check this flag in the code that describes a room to know which description to show

<video width='70%' data-autoplay loop src="../video/Adventure_M2.webm"></video>


## Milestone 3
- Implement the `QUIT`, `HELP`, and `LOOK` commands
- Adds extra commands that let the player do more than just move

<br>
<video width='70%' data-autoplay loop src="../video/Adventure_M3.webm"></video>

## Milestone 4
- Implement the `AdvObject` class
- Implement the methods in the `AdvRoom` class that make it possible to keep track of the objects in a room
- In the `AdvGame` class, write the code to put each object in its initial room (ignoring the `"PLAYER"` room for now)
- Change the code for displaying a room so that it displays a list of the objects in the room as well

## Milestone 5
- Implement the `TAKE`, `DROP`, and `INVENTORY` commands and any code you need to remember what the player is carrying

<br>
<video width='70%' data-autoplay loop src="../video/Adventure_M5.webm"></video>


## Milestone 6
- Implement synonym processing so that the player can use abbreviated forms of the directions and alternative names for the objects

## The `SmallSynonyms.txt` data file

:::


## Milestone 7
- Implement _locked passages_, which are passages that require a particular object to use
- Making this change requires moving `get_next_room` from `AdvRoom` to `AdvGame` so that it can see the objects

<br>
<video width='70%' data-autoplay loop src="../video/Adventure_M7.webm"></video>

:::


## Milestone 8
- Implement _forced motion_, in which the player is forced to immediately move from a room to a new room without issuing a command
	- Indicated by the verb `FORCED`
- Implementation of forced motion needs to allow some forced passages to still be locked
