## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: 1"}
Say I wrote a (bad) hash function that operated as:
```python
def hash(value):
	return len(str(value))
```
and that I then wrote a dictionary with a bucket hashing algorithm that utilized **5** buckets. If keys below were assigned to buckets according to our usual
```python
abs(hash(key)) % num_buckets
```
how many would end up assigned to the index 2 bucket?
```{style="font-size:.8em;"}
keys = "beast", "goat", "five", "skeleton", "turkey", 1011011
```

## Token ADT
- I find it helps to think of ADT's as a type of helps fulfill a particular objective or behavior goal
- Cast your mind back to our Pig Latin translation program, which had two main pieces
	- `to_pig_latin` which was responsible for taking a phrase and breaking it up into words
	- `word_to_pig_latin` which took a single word and translated into Pig Latin
- The first is an example of something that comes up often in computer science
	- Breaking a larger thing into particular smaller chunks
	- Chunks can really be anything, so the more general term computer scientists use is a _token_


## A Token Scanner
- A type that plucked out individual tokens might be called a _token scanner_
- What would a client want from a token scanner?
	- A way to pass in the necessary input
	- A way to retrieve the next individual token
	- A way to know when there are no more tokens
	- Maybe a way to tailor what tokens are desired
- These requirements help inform what methods should be incorporated into a token scanner class!
	- Still need to determine what internal attributes or method might be needed
-->

## Token Scanner Design
- Frequently, specific wants or objectives make for good methods to include in the token scanner
- Chapter 12 includes an example of a common implementation
- Exports 4 main methods:
	#. `scanner.set_input(str)`
		- Sets the input of the token scanner to the specified string or input stream
	#. `scanner.next_token()`
		- Returns the next token from the stream, or `""` at the end
	#. `scanner.has_more_tokens`
		- Returns `True` if more tokens exist, `False` otherwise
	#. `scanner.ignore_whitespace()`
		- Customization option which tells the scanner to ignore whitespace characters

## Token Scanner Code
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:.7em; font-spacing:2em;' data-line-numbers='7-46|54-59|63-69|71-86|88-94|96-100|104-109'}
# File: tokenscanner.py

"""
This file implements a simple version of a token scanner class.
"""

# A token scanner is an abstract data type that divides a string into
# individual tokens, which are strings of consecutive characters that
# form logical units.  This simplified version recognizes two token types:
#
#   1. A string of consecutive letters and digits
#   2. A single character string
#
# To use this class, you must first create a TokenScanner instance by
# calling its constructor:
#
#     scanner = TokenScanner()
#
# The next step is to call the set_input method to specify the string
# from which tokens are read, as follows:
#
#     scanner.set_input(s)
#
# Once you have initialized the scanner, you can retrieve the next token
# by calling
#
#    token = scanner.next_token()
#
# To determine whether any tokens remain to be read, you can either
# call the predicate method scanner.has_more_tokens() or check to see
# whether next_token returns the empty string.
#
# The following code fragment serves as a pattern for processing each
# token in the string stored in the variable source:
#
#     scanner = TokenScanner(source)
#     while scanner.has_more_tokens():
#         token = scanner.next_token()
#         . . . code to process the token . . .
#
# By default, the TokenScanner class treats whitespace characters
# as operators and returns them as single-character tokens.  You
# can set the token scanner to ignore whitespace characters by
# making the following call:
#
#     scanner.ignore_whitespace()

class TokenScanner:

    """This class implements a simple token scanner."""

        """

## Using `TokenScanner`
- Need to initialize the token scanner object
- Generally keep looping as long as there are still tokens
	- Each iteration, get the latest token and then do something with it


<!--## Using `TokenScanner` in `PigLatin`-->
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
from tokenscanner import TokenScanner

def to_pig_latin(text):
	translation = ""
	scanner = TokenScanner()
	scanner.set_input(text)
	while scanner.has_more_tokens():
		token = scanner.next_token()
		if token.isalpha():
			token = word_to_pig_latin(token)
		translation += token
	return translation
```

## Representing Data
- To use computation effectively, we frequently need to be able to represent real world data in a way that computers can easily work with
	- Real world data is often more complicated or nuanced than just "a list of numbers"
- Python's existing data structures are **tools**, which you can use to help represent certain ideas
	- _Lists_ when you have sequential type data, wherein there is a logical ordering to the data in question (where position matters)
		- Example: GPA over the course of 4 years
	- _Tuples_ or _classes_ when you have elements that should be grouped together but which have no inherent ordering. Generally use tuples for simple records and write custom classes for more complex. Could potentially also use a dictionary.
		- Example: Student names in a class
	- _Maps_ or _dictionaries_ when you have specific keys corresponding to other values.
		- Example: Student grades

## Tricky Data
- Human readable data is not always the best machine readable data!

Name | Class | Q1 | Mid | Q3 | Final
---|---|---|---|---|---
Sally | Python | A | B | B | A
Jake | Python | B | B | B | C
James | Astro | B | B | A |
Lily | Astro | A | A | B |
Ben | Python | C | B | B | A


## A Computer Friendly Approach
- Student grades are time ordered, so we could use a list for the grades
- Each student has a corresponding sequence of grades (and students are unordered), so we could use a dictionary where student names are the keys and the list of grades the values
- Each class corresponds to an unordered set of students. Could have another dictionary where the keys were the class names and the values were the dictionary of students/grades

## Example Representation
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
{
	"Python": {
		"Sally": ["A", "B", "B", "A"],
		"Jake": ["B", "B", "B", "C"],
		"Ben": ["C", "B", "B", "A"]
	},
	"Astro": {
		"James": ["B", "B", "A"],
		"Lily": ["A", "A", "B"]
	}
}
```

## File I/O
- Frequently want to be able to read in or write data to files in a smooth way to preserve these data structures
- A variety of ways this can be done
	- XML, TOML, JSON
- JSON is particularly interesting to us, because its syntax almost exactly matches Python's (even though it was made for Javascript)
- Python has a built in library to read and write JSON files
	- `json.load(file_handle)`
		- Loads the JSON data structure from the specified file into its Python equivalent
	- `json.dump(data_object, file_handle)`
		- Writes a JSON text representation of the data object to the given file
	- Both methods are used inside our normal `with open() as fhandle:` syntax

## Class Method Types
- When creating classes, we have been looking at _instance methods_ so far
	- Each method is tied to a particular object that it will act on
- There are class methods, but we won't see or spend time with those
- An alternative type of method are called _static methods_
	- Static methods are **not** tied to a particular object
	- They do **not** have self as the first parameter
	- Makes them very similar to just a normal function
	- Only in the class because they are related to everything else

## Creating Static Methods
- Create a static method using what is called a _decorator_ in Python
- You can imagine that decorators are special flags to Python that it should treat a particular method in a certain fashion.
- Decorators come immediately **before** the method header line, and start with the `@` symbol

```python
class MyNewClass:
	
	@staticmethod
	def my_method(not_self_1, not_self_2):
		print(not_self_1, not_self_2)
```

## Calling Static Methods
- Because the method is not attached to an object, you should not call it with the receiver dot syntax
- Must call them using the functional syntax, beginning with the class name
	- `MyNewClass.my_method(1,2)`
- Frequently used for functions that are related to the class but could otherwise be independent of the class
	- Examples: `GImage.get_red(pixel)` and `GImage.create_rgb_pixel(a,r,g,b)`

<!--
## Examples
- JSON formats tend to be the defacto way that the web passes around information, so easy to grab examples
- [Oregon District Voter Registration](https://data.oregon.gov/Administrative/Voter-Registration-Data/6a4f-ecbi)
-->

## Data-Driven Programs
- In most programming languages, data structures are easier to manipulate than the code itself
- Often useful then to push as much of the program behavior as possible into data structures rather than methods and functions
	- Programs working in this fashion are said to be _data driven_
- In a data-driven model, the actual program (commonly called the _driver_) is generally very small and simple simple managing:
	- Reading in data from a file into a suitable internal structure
	- Using the data structure to control the flow of the program

## The Teaching Machine
- Suppose you wanted to write a program that would give an "intelligent" quiz
	- Correct answers would move the client on to other, more difficult questions
	- Incorrect answers might give some explanation and then ask some follow up questions
- Having the questions and answers in some sort of data structure would make sense
- The teacher would generally be who comes up with the questions and progression though, and most teachers are not experts at writing code
	- Need a format that is largely not code based where teachers could construct the questions and progression
	- Need to translate that format into more common data structures that the computer can then understand and act on


## The Course Data File
- One common method of achieving this is to have configuration or data files
- The general format of a file is shown to the left, and an example question to the right
