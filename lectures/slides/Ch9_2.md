## Announcements
- Project 3 guide will be posted this weekend in case you want to get an early start
- I didn't quite make it all the way through the midterm. I'm sorry :(
	- Midway through the last problem
	- If you needed a grade check for potential withdrawal reasons, I've scored those and you should have heard back from me
- I've decided to not have an organized lab today
	- Everyone I think could use a break (myself included)
	- I need to be around the office some today to meet with people about any potential withdrawals
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)


## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: (1, 'a')"}
::::::cols
::::col
What would be the output of the printed statement in the code to the right?

:::{.poll}
#. `(1, 'a', 'b')`{.no-highlight}
#. `(1, 'a')`{.no-highlight}
#. Error: can't add strings and tuples
#. Error: index out of range
:::

::::

::::col
```python
A = (1, 3, 5)
B = (2*A, ('a', ) )
C = B + ('b', 'c', 'd')
D = ()
for v in C[:2]:
	D += v[:1]
print(D)
```

## Classes as Templates
- Since they share the same attributes, it is natural to regard the two employees at Scrooge and Marley as two instances of the same class
- Could view the class as a template or empty form:
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=35%
[record/.style={draw, minimum width=4cm, font=\tt},
lab/.style={font=\tt\small, anchor=south west},
]
\node[record, MBlue](n) at (0,0) {};
\node[lab, MBlue](nl) at (n.north west) {name};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of n](t){};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (t.north west) {title};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of t](s) {};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (s.north west) {salary};
\node[fit=(nl)(s), draw, very thick, MBlue] {};
\end{tikzpicture}

- Each data entry is what we would call an _attribute_ of the class
- Can help initially to just start with an empty template and then fill in the necessary fields/attributes


## Starting Empty
- Class definitions in Python start with a header line consisting of the keyword `class` and then the class name
- The body of the class will later contain definitions, but initially can just leave blank
	- Python does not allow an empty body, so need to include a docstring or `pass`
```python
class Employee:
	"""This class is currently empty!"""
```
- Once the class is defined, you can create an object of this class type by calling the class as if it were a function:
```python
clerk = Employee()
```

## More References
- Objects, like all values, are stored as _references_ to that information in memory
- Any code with access to this reference can manipulate the object
	- Can get or set the contents of any attributes or create new ones
<br><br>

![Objects are references!](../images/ObjectRepresentations.png)


## Selecting Object Attributes
- You can select an attribute from an object by writing out the object name, followed by a dot and then the attribute name.
	- As an example

		```python
		clerk.name
		```
		would select the `name` attribute for the `clerk` object
- Attributes are assignable, so

	```python
	clerk.salary *= 2
	```
	would double the clerk's current salary

- You can create a new attribute in Python by simply assigning a name and a value, just like you'd define a new variable


## Assigning Clerk Attributes
- We could, for instance, create a `clerk` in the following fashion:
```python
def create_clerk():
	clerk = Employee()
	clerk.name = "Bob Cratchit"
	clerk.title = "clerk"
	clerk.salary = 15
```
- Note that none of these assigned attributes affect the `Employee` class in any way


## Constructors
- While the previous method works, it is not ideal
	- Forces the client to tinker with the internal workings of the Employee
	- Details of the data structure are the property of the implementation, not the client
- Better to add a method to the `Employee` class called a _constructor_, which is responsible for initializing attributes to a newly created object
	- In Python, a constructor is created by defining a special function named `__init__`
	- The constructor function is called automatically whenever a new object of that type is created
- The first parameter to `__init__` is called `self`, which is a reference to the newly created object
	- Any other arguments provided are passed in as additional parameters

## An Employee Constructor
```python
class Employee:
	def __init__(self, name, title, salary):
		self.name = name
		self.title = title
		self.salary = salary


clerk = Employee('Bob Cratchit', 'clerk', 15)
```
- Note that you do not need to provide an argument for `self`, Python supplies this reference automatically


## Understanding Check
::::::cols

What is printed out on the final line of code to the right?

:::{.poll}
#. `Honda red 2006`{.no-highlight}
#. `Honda blue 2006`{.no-highlight}
#. `Toyota blue 2008`{.no-highlight}
#. `Honda red 2008`{.no-highlight}

```{.python style='max-height:800px'}
class Car:
	def __init__(self, color, year):
		self.color = color
		self.year = year
		self.make = 'Toyota'

A = Car('blue', 2008)
B = Car('red', 2006)
A.make = 'Honda'
A.year = B.year
print(A.make, A.color, A.year)
```

## What's your Method?
- Most classes define additional functions called methods to allow clients to read or update attributes or manipulate the object
- Methods look like a normal function definition but will **always** declare the parameter `self` at the beginning of the parameter list
	- This is true even if the method has no other parameters
- Methods are defined in the body of the class and would thus look something like:
```python
def method_name (self, other_parameters):
	...body of the method...
```
- For example
```python
def give_raise(self, amount):
	self.salary += amount
```

## Accessing and Using Methods
- After definition, there are two mains ways you can access and use the method
	- **Dot Notation (Conventional)**
		- Python sets `self` to be a reference to the _receiver_, which is the object to which the method is applied
		```python
		C = Employee('Bob', 'clerk', 15)
		C.give_raise(15)
		```

	- **Function Notation**
		- You retrieve the method from the class itself, and then provide self manually
		```python
		C = Employee('Bob', 'clerk', 15)
		Employee.give_raise(C, 15)
		```

## Visualization Summary
- To summarize in a visual manner, we can look at everything together on [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/live.html#code=class%20Employee%3A%0A%20%20%20%20def%20__init__%28self,%20name,%20title,%20salary%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20self.name%20%3D%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20self.title%20%3D%20title%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20self.salary%20%3D%20salary%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20def%20give_raise%28self,%20amount%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20current%20%3D%20self.salary%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20self.salary%20%2B%3D%20amount%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A%0Aclerk%20%3D%20Employee%28%22Bob%20Cratchit%22,%20%22clerk%22,%2015%29%0Aboss%20%3D%20Employee%28%22Scrooge%22,%20%22founder%22,%201000%29%0A%0Aclerk.give_raise%2820%29&cumulative=false&curInstr=1&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-live.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false)

## Getters and Setters
- In the object-oriented model, the client is not supposed to muck-about with the object internals
- The implementation should therefore provide methods to retrieve desired attributes (called _getters_) or to make changes to desired attributes (called _setters_)
- Setting up getters and setters for the attribute `salary` might look like:
```python
def get_salary(self):
	return self.salary

def set_salary(self, new_salary):
	self.salary = new_salary
```
- Getters are far more common than setters, as you don't always want the client to have the freedom to change attributes on a whim


## Representation
- Printing out an object that you just created as an instance of a custom class will look ugly:
```python-repl
>>> C = Employee('Bob', 'clerk', 15)
>>> print(C)
<__main__.Employee object at 0x7f942ba13550>
```
- You can define special methods for a class that specify how your object should be converted to a string (or anything else really)
	- All these special methods have double underscores before and after
	- Define the `__str__` method to specify how your object should be printed

## A Good Employee
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
class Employee:
	def __init__(self, name, title, salary):
		self.name = name
		self.title = title
		self.salary = salary

	def __str__(self):
		return f"{self.name} ({self.title}): {self.salary}"

	def get_salary(self):
		return self.salary

	def set_salary(self, new_salary):
		self.salary = new_salary
```
