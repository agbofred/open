## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: 3rd avenue and 4th street"}
::::::cols
::::col
Suppose you had Karel starting in the world shown to the right. If Karel then executed the commands shown to the far right, what intersection would they end up at?
::::
::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{4}{4}
\draw[MGreen, very thick] (2.5,0.5) --++(0,2);
\karelmark[MYellow]{2}{3}{-90}

\end{tikzpicture}
::::
::::col
```python
move()
turn_left()
turn_left()
move()
move()
turn_left()
turn_left()
turn_left()
move()
```
::::
::::::
:::{.hpoll}
#. 2nd avenue and 1st street
#. 4th avenue and 2nd street
#. 3rd avenue and 4th street
#. Karel would hit a wall and error

## Watching Karel Work
- In Python, can run Karel programs by including `import karel` near the top of the program
	- The file `karel.py` also needs to be in the same directory as your program

![Karel Interface](../images/KarelGui.svg)


## Functional Programs
- Recall that we had to execute 3 left turns whenever we wanted to turn right
- _Functions_ give us a way to "bundle-up" this code in a form that is easier to use!
	- This is largely a convenience
	- Especially useful when the same sequence of commands is used repeatedly
- Using functions takes place in two parts:

::::::cols
::::col
:::{.block name="The Definition"}
- Where you define what is in the bundle
- Syntactically, it looks like:

```python
def your_function_name():
	any_commands_to_be_bundled
```
- Note that bundled commands need to be tabbed in!
:::
::::
::::col
:::{.block name="The Usage"}
- Where you use the earlier defined bundle (function)
- Commonly called _calling_ the function
- Use matched parentheses after the function name:

```python
your_function_name()
```
:::

## Turn Right Round {data-auto-animate=true}
::::::cols
::::col
- We can define a convenience function to turn right!

```python
def turn_right():
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
```
- Then we can just type `turn_right()` whenever we want to turn right
- Internally, this is **no** different from what we had before (Karel still turns left 3 times), it is just easier to read and write
::::

::::col
```{.python style='max-height:800px' data-trim=true data-line-numbers=true data-id="code"}
def main():
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	turn_left()
	move()
	move()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	pick_beeper()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	move()
	put_beeper()
```

	turn_left()
	turn_left()
```

## Pothole Decomposition
- Functions can also be a very effective way to break a larger problem into smaller, more managable pieces
- Suppose we wanted Karel to fill all the "holes" in the below world with a beeper

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=60%
\karelgrid{6}{3}{MGreen}


\draw[very thick, MGreen] (1.5,0.5) --++(0,1) --++(-1,0) 
						  (2.5,0.5) --++(0,1) --++(2,0) --++(0,-1) 
						  (5.5,0.5) --++(0,1) --++(1,0);
\karelmark[fill=MYellow]{1}{2}{0}
\end{tikzpicture}

## Breaking down Potholes
::::::cols
::::col
- From a big picture perspective, we might break this down something like:
	- Moving between potholes
	- Filling a pothole
- Wherever one of those actions is simple and routine enough to write a function, we probably should!
	- Moving between potholes: this is not currently routine as the amount we need to move changes
	- Filling a pothole: this would be the same every time!
::::

::::col
```{.python style='max-height: 900px' .fragment}
def main():
	move()
	fill_pothole()
	move()
	move()
	fill_pothole()
	move()

def fill_pothole():
	turn_right()
	move()
	put_beeper()
	turn_around()
	move()
	turn_right()

def turn_right():
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()

def turn_around():
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
```

## A Quick Comment
- It is **always** a good idea to document and leave notes to yourself (or future readers of your code)
- _Comments_ are pieces of text in your program that are ignored when the program is run
- Python has two methods to make a comment:
	- Hashtag method: Everything following a hashtag (#) is ignored

		```python
		# This is a short comment!
		```
		- Commonly used to make quick explanatory or labeling comments
	- Triple quote method: Every inside triple quotes (""") is ignored

		```python
		""" This is also a comment! """
		```
		- Commonly used to describe what functions do
		- Can span multiple lines

## Commenting Example
```{.python style='max-height: 900px'}
def main():
	"""
	Main function to fill 2 potholes 
	at known locations.
	"""
	move()
	fill_pothole()
	move()
	move()
	fill_pothole()
	move()

def fill_pothole():
	"""
	Fills a single pothole and returns 
	to where it started. 
	"""
	turn_right()
	move()
	put_beeper() #assuming infinite beepers available
	turn_around()
	move()
	turn_right()

def turn_right():
	""" Turns Karel 90 to the right. """
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()

def turn_around():
	""" Convenience function to turn Karel 180 around. """
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
```

## Making Choices
- To solve more interesting tasks, we need to be able to write programs that can make choices about what they should be doing
- Commands that alter the order that a program will run its commands are called _control statements_, which come in two flavors:
	- _Conditional statements_: Only run portions of the program if a certain condition is true
	- _Iterative statements_: Repeat portions of the program if certain conditions are met
- Conditions are answers to yes or no (or true/false) type questions
	- Am I facing a wall?
	- Do I have any beepers in my bag?
- You can ask these questions of Karel using what are _predicate functions_, which are the programming equivalent of yes-or-no questions

## Interrogating Karel
Potential questions you can ask Karel include:

 | 
---|----
`front_is_clear()` | `front_is_blocked()`
`left_is_clear()` |  `left_is_blocked()`
`right_is_clear()` | `right_is_blocked()`
`beepers_present()` | `no_beepers_present()`
`beepers_in_bag()` | `no_beepers_in_bag()`
`facing_north()` | `not_facing_north()`
`facing_south()` | `not_facing_south()`
`facing_east()` | `not_facing_east()`
`facing_west()` | `not_facing_west()`

## Kinda Iffy
- Predicate functions can be used to control a kind of "switch": running one piece of code if the answer is yes and a different piece of code if the answer is no.
- Commonly called _if_ or _if-else_ statements, they take on the syntax of:

	```python
	if conditional_test:
		# Code to run if test answer is yes
	else:
		# Code to run if test answer is no
	```
- If you don't want the code to do anything special if the answer is no, you can ignore the "else" part of the statement:
	
	```python
	if conditional_test:
		# Code to run if test is true
	# Carrying on with code that will always run
	```

## Its been a while
- Another common use of predicate functions is in controlling a type of iterative function called a _while_ loop
- The structure of a while loop looks like:
```python
while some_conditional_test:
	# Code to repeat as long as the answer
	# to the conditional_test is yes (true)
# Code to run once the answer is no
```
- All of our predicate functions give yes-or-no answers though! So we can do something like

	```python
	while front_is_clear():
		move()
	```
	which will continually move Karel forward as long as there is not a wall in front of them!



## Smarty Karel
- Combining conditional statements with loops lets us write a program for Karel in which it can **react** to different situations in different ways, all using the same code
- Our pothole code from earlier could **only** handle two potholes, and they had to be perfectly spaced
- With one loop and one if statement, we can make the program fill any number of potholes with any manner of spacing!
- Key questions:
	- How do we know when we are done?
	- How do we know when we reach a pothole?

## Smart Potholes
```{.python style='max-height: 900px'}
def main():
	"""
	Main function to fill any number of
	potholes at any location!
	"""
	while front_is_clear():
		if right_is_clear():
			fill_pothole()
		move()

def fill_pothole():
	"""
	Fills a single pothole and returns 
	to where it started. 
	"""
	turn_right()
	move()
	put_beeper() #assuming infinite beepers available
	turn_around()
	move()
	turn_right()

def turn_right():
	""" Turns Karel 90 deg to the right. """
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()

def turn_around():
	""" Turns Karel 180 deg around. """
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
```
