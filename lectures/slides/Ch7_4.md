	- You can bring print copies of notes or past code you've written for lab, problem sets, or projects
	- No computers or internet capable devices allowed
	- Python summary pdf will be included with test
	- Pencils > Pens if you plan to make any mistakes or change your mind
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)


## Review! {data-notes="Solution: D, others print the ."}

::::col
To the right are the contents of a text file named `PBride.txt`. Which code snippet below would print off the word "father"?
::::

::::col
```{.no-highlight style="color:white;"}
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
```

## Aren't you Exceptional
- When opening a file for reading, it is possible the file does not exist!
	- Python handle this (and many other potential errors that can arise) using a mechanism called _exception handling_
	- Common on other languages as well
- An _exception_ is a object that belongs to an overarching hierarchy of exception classes
	- Different classes/types for different purposes
	- File operations, for example, use the exception class `IOError`
- If `open` encounters an error, it reports the error by _raising an exception_ with `IOError` as its type.
	- Raising an exception generally immediately terminates your program, but sometimes that is undesirable


## Ignore Yoda, there is a `try`
- Python uses the `try` statement to indicate an interest in trying to handle a possible exception
- In simplest form, the syntax is:
```python
try:
	# Code that may cause an exception
except type_of_exception:
	# Code to handle that type of exception
```
- `type_of_exception` here is the class name of the exception being handled
	- `IOError` for the file reading errors we are discussing
- Any exceptions arising from within the `try` block or within functions **called** within the try block would be "caught"

## Example: Requesting Existing File
- As an example, the below function will repeatedly ask the user to supply a file name that actually exists. 
- It will not just immediately break should they give it an invalid filename!
```python
def get_existing_file(prompt="Input a filename: "):
	while True:
		filename = input(prompt)
		try:
			with open(filename):
				return filename
		except IOError:
			print("That filename is invalid!")
```
- If the `open` call succeeds, we immediately just return the filename, but if it fails due to a `IOError`, we display a message and then keep asking


## Choosing Wisely
- The Python package used to implement `pgl.py` also supports a mechanism to choose files interactively, made available through the `filechooser.py` library module.
- `filechooser.py` exports two functions:
	- `choose_input_file` for selecting a file
	- `choose_output_file` for selecting a folder and filename to save a file to
- Both open up a file dialog that lets you select/choose a file
	- Clicking Open or Save returns the full pathname of the file
	- Clicking Cancel returns an empty string

<!--
- Using it thus looks something like:
```python
filename = choose_input_file()
with open(filename) as f:
	# Code to read file
```
-->


## Writing Text Files
- You can write text files using almost the same syntax as reading:
```python
with open(filename, mode) as file_handle:
	# Code to write the file using file_handle
```
- Note the `mode` parameter to `open` here! Mode is a string which is either
	- `"w"` to **write** a new file (or overwrite an existing file)
	- `"a"` to **append** new contents to the end of an existing file
- The file handler supports the methods:
	- `.write(some_string)` to write a string to the file
	- `.writelines(iterable_of_strings)` to write each iterable element to the file


## Writing ASCII SINE
- Suppose I wanted to try my hand at some ASCII art and fill a text file with a vertical oscillating sine wave
- A sine wave generally looks like:
	$$ A \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}x\right)$$
  where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave and $T$ the period of the wave, or how quickly it repeats
- How can we put this together?


## Tabulation
- Arrays can also be useful when you have a set of values and you need to count how many values fall into a different ranges
	- Process is called _tabulation_
- The idea is that for each data file we encounter, we figure out a corresponding index in our tabular array and then increment the value of that element
- Your book shows this for seeing how many times each letter of the alphabet appears in a text sequence
- Let's instead look at an example of determining how many students got different letters grades on a final


## Multidimensional Arrays
- We know that elements of a list can be lists in and of themselves. If the lengths of all the lists making up the elements of a list remain fixed, then the list of lists is called a _multidimensional array_
- In Python, we can create multidimensional arrays just be creating lists of constant length as the elements to another list
```python
magic = [ [2, 9, 4], [7, 5, 3], [6, 1, 8] ]
```
- We can always get the individual element of one of the inner lists by using **2** indices.
	- `magic[1][1] = 5`
	- `magic[-1][0] = 6`


## Picturing Multidimensional Arrays
- Multidimensional arrays are general pictured as each inner list being stacked beneath the previous
- As such, the outermost elements/indices represent the row, and the inner elements/indices represent the column
`[ [2, 9, 4], [7, 5, 3], [6, 1, 8] ]`{style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;"}
