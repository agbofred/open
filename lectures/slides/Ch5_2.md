## Announcements
- Problem Set 3 due on Monday!
- I will be posting the Project 1 guide sometime tomorrow, so if you are a little ahead of the game you can get going on it sooner.
	- At the latest, you should plan to start work on Project 1 **Tuesday** next week
	- Projects take time, and setting aside some time each day to work on another piece is the best way to ensure you don't reach the end of the week in panic mode
- Lab today!

## New Methods
- A new method that acts on a `GWindow`:

 |
:---|:----
`get_element_at(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns the frontmost object at (x,y) or `None`

- And more new methods that act on any `GObject`

 | 
:---|:---------
`set_location(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Resets the location of the object to the specified point
`move(dx,dy)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dx` and `dy` pixels from its current position
`move_polar(dr,theta)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dr` pixel units in direction `theta`
`contains(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns `True` if the object contains the specified point
`get_color()`{.no-highlight} | Returns the color currently assigned to the object


## The Python Event Model
- Graphical applications usually make it possible for the user to control the action of a program by using an input device such a mouse.
	- Programs supporting this type of control are called _interactive programs_.
- User actions such as clicking the mouse are called _events_.
- Programs that respond to events are said to be _event driven_.
- User input does not generally occur at predictable times. As the events are not controlled by the program, they are said to be _asynchronous_.
- In Python, you write a function that acts as a _listener_ for a particular event type. When the event happens, the listener is called.


## First Class Functions
- Functions in Python are treated as data values just like anything else!
	- We will need to take advantage of this to write listener functions.
- You can assign a function to a variable, pass it as a parameter, return it as a result, etc
- Functions treated like any other data value are called _first-class functions_
- To work with a function itself, you leave off the `()`. Including the parentheses is how you _call_ the function!


## A First Class Example
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
import math

def evaluate_numbers(func):
	print(func)
	print(func(0))
	print(func(2))
	print(func(10))

A = evaluate_numbers

A(math.sqrt)
A(math.exp)
```

- `f2` must also keep track of any local variables!
- The local variables that are included as part of a function are called its _closure_

b = 1
def f1(a):
    print(a)

	def f2():
		c = a + b
		return c * 3
	return f2 

f2 = f1(10) 
c = f2()

## Our First Interactive Example
- Consider the simple program below, where we've imported the basics and some of our helper functions
```python
def draw_dots():
    def click_action(event):
        c = create_filled_rect(
            event.get_x(), event.get_y(), 
            10,10, random_color())
        gw.add(c)

    gw = GWindow(500, 500)
    gw.add_event_listener("click", click_action)
```
- The `click_action` function specifies what to do when the mouse is clicked
	- Note that it has access to the `gw` variable since it is in the enclosing function and thus in the closure.


## Registering a Listener
- The last line of our example function:

	```python
	gw.add_event_listener("click", click_action)
	```
	tells the graphics window (`gw`) to call the `click_action` function whenever a mouse "click" occurs within the window.
- When the user clicks the mouse, the graphics window, in essense, calls the client back to let them know that a click has occured. Thus, functions such as `click_action` are known as _callback functions_.
- The parameter `event` given to the callback function is a special data structure called a _mouse event_, which contains details about the specifics of the event that triggered the action.


## Mouse Events
- We have a fairly comprehensive list of mouse-events that we can trigger callbacks on:

| Name | Description
---:|:-----
`"click"` | The user clicks the mouse in the window
`"dblclk"` | The user double-clicks the mouse in the window
`"mousedown"` | The user presses the mouse button down
`"mouseup"` | The user releases the mouse button
`"mousemove"` | The user moves the mouse
`"drag"` | The user moves the mouse with the button down


## Event Details
- Certain actions can trigger more than one event
	- Clicking generates a "mousedown", "mouseup", and then "click" event, in that order
- Events trigger no action unless the window is listening for that event
	- If I drag my mouse in the `draw_dots()` function, you'll notice that nothing happens
- You can setup however many listeners you feel you need in order to make your program behave as desired
```python
gw.add_event_listener("click", click_action)
gw.add_event_listener("dblclk", dblclk_action)
```

## Line Drawing
- Say we wanted to write a simple program that allows the user to draw lines by clicking and dragging the mouse
- Using two event listeners would be useful:
	- "mousedown" could start drawing a zero-length line at the current mouse position (and add it to the window)
	- "drag" could update the end-point of that line
- The strategy would allow the user to have visual feedback as they drag around, helping them to position the line
	- Since the line stretches and contracts as you move the cursor around, the technique is commonly called _rubber-banding_

## Attempt #1
```{.python .badcode style="max-height:900px;"}
from pgl import GWindow, GLine

WIDTH = 500
HEIGHT = 500

def draw_lines():
	def mousedown_event(e):
		x = e.get_x()
		y = e.get_y()
		line = GLine(x,y,x,y)
		gw.add(line)

	def drag_action(e):
		line.set_end_point(e.get_x(), e.get_y())

	gw = GWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
	line = None
	gw.add_event_listener("mousedown", mousedown_event)
	gw.add_event_listener("drag", drag_action)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	draw_lines()
```

## What Happened?
- Remember that if you define a variable in a function, that variable is assumed to be local!
	- Keeps you from accidentally overwriting variables you may not have meant to
	- It works against us here, since we WANT to override the original value
- We can't pass in the info as a parameter, since it is not part of the event information
- Python _does_ have a `nonlocal` keyword, which allows you to state that a specific variable is _not_ local, but it tends to just confuse students
- In this class, we'll store all variables that need to be shared between two or more functions in a _state object_
	- Just a collection of values stored as a single object
	- The object is defined in the main function, and then we can access and insert or recall values from it


## Using `GState`
- The PGL library has a `GState` object type that we can import to use for sharing data between callback functions
- Create a variable, conventionally called `gs` immediately after creating the window:
```python
gw = GWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
gs = GState()
```
- Value to be shared can be stored as part of the `gs` variable as an object attribute, which we will talk much more about in Ch 9
	- For now, shared variables should include `gs` and then a period before the variable name.
	- So `line` will become `gs.line` everywhere in our example

## Fixed Line-Drawing
```{.python style="max-height:900px;"}
from pgl import GWindow, GLine, GState

WIDTH = 500
HEIGHT = 500

def draw_lines():
	def mousedown_event(e):
		x = e.get_x()
		y = e.get_y()
		gs.line = GLine(x,y,x,y)
		gw.add(gs.line)

	def drag_action(e):
		gs.line.set_end_point(e.get_x(), e.get_y())

	gw = GWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
	gs = GState()
	gs.line = None
	gw.add_event_listener("mousedown", mousedown_event)
	gw.add_event_listener("drag", drag_action)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	draw_lines()
```
