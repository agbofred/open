## Boolean Expressions
- Python defines two types of operators that work with Boolean data: _relational operators_ and _logical operators_
- Relational operators compare values of other types and produce a `True`/`False` result:

	---- ----------------- - - - ---- --------------------
	`==` Equals                  `!=` Not equals
	 `<` Less than               `<=` Less than or equal too
	 `>` Greater than            `>=` Greater than or equal to
	---- ----------------- - - - ---- --------------------
- Be careful! `==` _compares_ two booleans. A single `=` _assigns_ a variable. The odds are high you'll use one when you meant the other at least once this semester!


## The Vulcan Way
- Logical operators act on Boolean pairings

	Operator | Description
	---|---
	`A and B` | True if both terms True, False otherwise
	`A or B` | True if _any_ term is True, False otherwise
	`not A` | True if A False, False if A True (opposite)

::: incremental
- Order of operations follows parentheses and then proceeds left to right
- Careful that `or` is still `True` if both options are `True` which is a little different than common English use
- Similarly, careful with combining `not` with `and` and `or`
	- "Not A or B" in common English is not the same as `not A or B`

## Understanding Check{data-notes="Solution: True"}
What is the final printed value in the code below?

:::: cols
::: col
:::::{.poll}
#. `True`
#. `False`
#. `"4Quiz"`
#. This would give an error
:::::
:::

::: {.col style="flex-grow:2;"}
```python
A = 10
B = 4
C = "Quiz"
A *= len(C)
if A > 40 and C != "C":
	print(str(B)+C)
else:
	print(A < B or not (C == "C"))

```

## Shorting the Circuit
- Python evaluates _and_ and _or_ operators using a strategy called _short-circuit mode_
- Only evaluates the right operand if it actually needs to
	- Example: Consider the statement 

		```python
		n != 0 and x % n == 0
		```
		If `n=0`, then the `x % n == 0` is never actually checked in the statement
		since `n != 0` is already `False` and `False and ` _anything_ is always `False`!
- Can use short-circuit to prevent errors: the above `x % n == 0` statement would have erred out if `n=0`

## Sentinels
- Many programs in programming can be approched similarly by using a particular _idiom_ or _pattern_
- A common one with repetition is to use a variable to keep track of the loop state until something particular happens (the sentinel is triggered)
<br><br>

```python
finished = False
while not finished:
	line = input("Enter a number: ")
	if line == "":
		finished = True
	else:
		print(line)
```

## For Loop Anatomy
- We know that `for` loops have a simple syntax:

	```python
	for variable_name in sequence:
		# code to loop over
	```
- `variable_name` is a variable name that will be assigned every value in the sequence over the course of the loop
- `sequence` is any expression that produces a variable that supports iteration


## The `range()` iterable
- Need an easy way to produce or describe a range of numeric values
- The built-in `range()` function handles this and produces the needed iterable object
- Takes 1, 2, or 3 arguments (or inputs):
	- Start (default 0): where to start the sequence at
	- Stop (mandatory): the sequence ends just _below_ this value (does not include it!)
	- Step (default 1): what value the sequence counts by
<br><br>

:::{.block name='Warning!'}
Be careful, the `range` function will stop one step _before_ the final stop value.
:::


## For ranging examples
- Providing just a stop argument:

	```python
	for n in range(5):
		print(n)
	```
- Providing a start and stop:

	```python
	for n in range(1,11):
		print(n)
	```
- Providing a start, stop, and step:

	```python
	for n in range(10,0,-1):
		print(n)
	```


## Iterating over sequences
- We can also use a `for` loop to iterate directly over a sequence of values
- Python supports many different types of sequences, but thus far we only know about one: strings!
	- Recall strings are just a sequence of individual characters
- We can loop through a string to examine each individual character
- Example looping through to count occurances of a given letter:

	```python
	def count_letters(letter, string):
		count = 0
		for character in string:
			if character == letter:
				count += 1
		return count
	```

## Understanding Check {data-notes="Answer is B, as it would not print the 0"}
Which of the below blocks of code would print something different than the others?

::::: cols

:::: col
:::{.block name=A}
```python
for n in range(10):
	if n % 2 == 0:
		print(n)
```
:::
:::{.block name=B}
```python
for i in range(0,10,2):
	if i > 0:
		print(i)
```
:::
::::

:::: col
:::{.block name=C}
```python
for j in range(0,20,4):
	L = j // 2
	print(L)

```
:::
:::{.block name=D}
```python
for k in range(0,10):
	if not k % 2 > 0:
		print(k)
```
:::
::::
:::::


## Nesting Loops
- Most anything can go in the repeating block of a loop, _including other loops_
- The inner most loop must finish **all** of its iterations before the outer loop finishes a **single** iteration
- Useful when you need to iterate over multiple different values
	- Example: generating multiplication tables

	```python
	for a in range(1,5):
		for b in range(1,5):
			print(a*b)
	```


## The Worth of a Picture
- There comes a time when reading and entering text on a terminal doesn't cut it
	- Maybe you need more complicated input
	- Maybe you need a more complicated interface that pure text can manage
	- Maybe you have output that can not be shown as text
- Standard Python really only deals with the terminal interface
- Lots of outside libraries give Python more visual input/output
	- Turtle
	- Matplotlib
	- Tkinter <span class='fragment'>‚Üê PGL</span>
	- PyGame
	- Arcade


## The Portable Graphics Library
- Built atop Tkinter
- The library (`pgl.py`) is available on the website
	- Put it in the same folder as your code, and then you can import it
- Operates on the idea of a collage or cork-board

![Test](../images/CorkBoard.svg)

- Note that newer objects can obscure older objects. This layering arrangement is called the _stacking order_.


## The Pieces
- At its simplest then, we have two main parts:
	- The window (or felt-board/cork-board)
		- Created with the `GWindow` function
		- Takes two arguments: a width and a height in pixels
	- The contents
		- A wide assortment of shapes that can be added to the scene
		- Control over where they are placed, how large they are, what color they are, etc


## Blue Rectangle!
```{.python data-line-numbers="1|3,4|6|7|8|9|10|11"}
from pgl import GWindow, GRect

GW_WIDTH = 500
GW_HEIGHT = 200

gw = GWindow(GW_WIDTH, GW_HEIGHT)
rect = GRect(150, 50 ,200, 100)
rect.set_color("Blue")
rect.set_filled(True)
gw.add(rect)
```

## The Coordinate System
![PGL Coordinates](../images/pgl_coordinates.svg)

- Positions and distances on the screen are measured in terms of pixels
- The location of the origin and orientation of the y-axis are **different from math**!
	- Origin is in the upper left instead of lower left
	- Y-values increase as you move downwards

## Other Simple Objects
Functions to create simple geometric objects:
<br>

- Rectangles!
	- `GRect( x, y, width, height )`
	- Creates a rectangle whose upper left corner is at (x,y) of the specified size
- Circles/Ovals!
	- `GOval( x, y, width, height )`
	- Creates an oval that fits inside the rectangle with the same dimensions
- Lines!
	- `GLine( x1, y1, x2, y2 )`
	- Creates a line extending from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2)
