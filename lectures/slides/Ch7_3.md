## Announcements
- Project 2 due tonight!
- Graphical Contest deadline is a week from Friday
- Midterm is on Friday!
	- Study materials and practice tests have been posted
	- Section meetings this week will be ready to talk about specific problems, but you _need to have started them to know what problems you have questions about_.
	- Test is open-note and printouts of code you've written. Just no computers.
	- I'll include the Python summary pdf with the test.
	- Will be written for just an hour, but I'll let you use the lab hour afterwards if you need time to finish up.
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)

<!-- Actually covered at the end of last class
## Review Question
::::::cols
::::col
Given the code to the right, what would be the final printed value of `A`?


:::{.poll}
#. `['Fox', 'Giraffe', 'Hippo', 'Iguana']`
#. `['Fox', 'Hippo', 'Iguana']`
#. `['Iguana', 'Fox']`
#. `['Fox', 'Iguana']`
:::

::::

::::col
```python
A = ['Fox', 'Giraffe', 
	 'Hippo']
A.append('Iguana')
A[:].reverse()
B = A
for anim in B:
	if anim[1] == 'i':
		B.remove(anim)
print(A)
```

## Review! {data-notes="Solution: '1111'"}
What is the second element (index 1) in the below list?

`[i * 4 for i in "Oct 18, 2020" if not i.isalpha()]`{style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;"}

<br>

:::{.poll}
#. `16`
#. `"8888"`
#. `"cccc"`
#. `"1111"`

## Where Strings and Lists Meet
- There are a handful of methods that provide interactions between strings and lists

Method | Description
--- | ------
`str.split()` | Splits the string `str` into a list of its components using whitespace as a separator
`str.split(sep)` | Splits the string `str` into a list using the specified separator `sep`
`str.splitlines()` | Splits the string `str` into a list of strings at the newline character
`str.join(list)` | Joins the (string) elements of the `list` into a string, using `str` as the separator


## Reading
- Programs often need to work with lists that are too large to reasonably exist typed all out in the code
	- Easier to read in the values of a list from some external data file
- A _file_ is the generic name for any named collection of data maintained on some permanent storage media attached to a computer
- Files can contain information of many different types and encodings
	- Most common is the _text file_
	- Contains character data like you'd find in a string


## Strings vs Text Files
- While strings and text files both store characters, there are some important differences:
	- **The longevity of the data stored**
		- The value of a string variable lasts only as long as the string exists, is not overridden, or is not thrown out when a function completes
		- Information in a text file exists until the file is deleted
	- **How data is read in**
		- You have access to all the characters in a string variable pretty much immediately
		- Data from text files is generally read in sequentially, starting from the beginning and proceeding until the end of the file is reached

## Reading Text Files
- The general approach for reading a text file is to first _open_ the file and associate that file with a variable, commonly called its _file handle_
- We will also use the _with_ keyword to ensure that Python cleans up after itself (closes the file) when we are done with it (Many of us could use a `with` irl)
```python
with open(filename) as file_handle:
	# Code to read the file using the file_handle
```
- Python gives you several different ways to actually read in the data
	- `read` reads the entire file in as a string
	- `readline` or `readlines` reads a single line or lines from the file
	- `read` alongside `splitlines` gets you a list of line strings
	- Can use the file handle as an iterator to loop over

## Entire file ‚ü∂  String
- The `read` method reads the entire file into a string, with includes newline characters to mark the end of lines
- Simple, but can be cumbersome to work with in some cases, and, for large files, can take a large amount of memory

As an example, the file:<br><br>

:::{.block name="Seuss.txt"}
One fish<br>
two fish<br>
red fish<br>
blue fish
:::

would get read as

`"One fish\ntwo fish\nred fish\nblue fish"`{style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;"}

## Line by Line
- Of the ways to read the file in a string at a time, using the file handler as an iterator and looping is probably best and certainly most flexible
- Leads to code that looks like:
```python
with open(filename) as f:
	for line in f:
		# Do something with the line
```
- Note that **most** strategies preserve the newline character, which you very likely do not want, so be ready to strip them out before doing more processing


## Powers Combined
- So long as your files are not gigantic, using `read` and then the `splitlines` method can be a good option
- This **does** remove the newline characters, since it splits the string at them
```python
with open(filename) as f:
	lines = f.read().splitlines()
# Then you can do whatever you want with the list of lines
```

## Example: Name Mangling
- Let's look at an example with some more meat to it
- I have a text file with all your first names. I'd like to:
	- Read in the names
	- Select two at random
	- Combine the first half of one name with the second half of the other
	- Print out both potential hybrid names
- We'll practice breaking a problem into steps along the way here


## Aren't you Exceptional
- When opening a file for reading, it is possible the file does not exist!
	- Python handles this (and many other potential errors that can arise) using a mechanism called _exception handling_
	- Common in other languages as well
- An _exception_ is a object that belongs to an overarching hierarchy of exception classes
	- Different classes/types for different purposes
	- File operations, for example, use the exception class `IOError`
- If `open` encounters an error, it reports the error by _raising an exception_ with `IOError` as its type.
	- Raising an exception generally immediately terminates your program, but sometimes that is undesirable


## Ignore Yoda, there is a `try`
- Python uses the `try` statement to indicate an interest in trying to handle a possible exception
- In simplest form, the syntax is:
```python
try:
	# Code that may cause an exception
except type_of_exception:
	# Code to handle that type of exception
```
- `type_of_exception` here is the class name of the exception being handled
	- `IOError` for the file reading errors we are discussing
- Any exceptions arising from within the `try` block or within functions *called* within the try block would be "caught" and the lower block of code run instead of terminating the program

## Example: Requesting Existing File
- As an example, the below function will repeatedly ask the user to supply a file name that actually exists. 
- It will not just immediately break should they give it an invalid filename!
```python
def get_existing_file(prompt="Input a filename: "):
	while True:
		filename = input(prompt)
		try:
			with open(filename):
				return filename
		except IOError:
			print("That filename is invalid!")
```
- If the `open` call succeeds, we immediately just return the filename, but if it fails due to a `IOError`, we display a message and then keep asking
