## Simulation
- Our technique of piecing together many small movements to resemble motion is not limited to just making pretty animations!
- Physicists use similar techniques to break complex problems into simple pieces
	- "In this small time interval, the motion is simple"
	- Chain together many time intervals to construct the full motion
- There are many areas where this is the **only** way to solve a problem, as we can not write down equations to express the result otherwise!

## The Two Body Problem
```{.python style="max-height:950px;"}
from pgl import GWindow, GOval, GLine, GState
from pgl_tools import create_filled_circle

def two_body():
    def step():
        # Compute forces and accelerations
        dx = planet1.get_x() - planet2.get_x()
        dy = planet1.get_y() - planet2.get_y()
        r3 = (dx ** 2 + dy ** 2) ** (3 / 2)
        ax = 1000 / r3 * dx
        ay = 1000 / r3 * dy

        # Compute velocities
        gs.vx1 += -ax
        gs.vy1 += -ay
        gs.vx2 += ax
        gs.vy2 += ay

        # Draw history paths
        path1 = GLine(
            planet1.get_x() + 10,
            planet1.get_y() + 10,
            planet1.get_x() + 10 + gs.vx1,
            planet1.get_y() + 10 + gs.vy1,
        )
        path1.set_color("red")
        path1.set_line_width(3)

        path2 = GLine(
            planet2.get_x() + 10,
            planet2.get_y() + 10,
            planet2.get_x() + 10 + gs.vx2,
            planet2.get_y() + 10 + gs.vy2,
        )
        path2.set_color("cyan")
        path2.set_line_width(3)

        # Move them
        planet1.move(gs.vx1, gs.vy1)
        planet2.move(gs.vx2, gs.vy2)

        gw.add(path1)

    gw.add(planet2)

## Something to smile about

<!--- Up until now, we haven't had a way to draw an arc!-->
- The `GArc` class represents an arc formed by taking a section of the perimeter of an oval.
- 3 things necessary:
	- The bounding rectangle geometry (upper left corner and width and height)
	- The _starting angle_ (in degrees)
	- The _sweep angle_ (in degrees) which is how far the arc extends
- Negative angles move in the clockwise direction
::::

::::col

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\draw[MPurple] (-2,0) -- (2,0) (0,-2) -- (0,2);
\draw[dashed, MBlue] (-1.5,-1.5) rectangle (1.5, 1.5);
\draw[ultra thick, MRed] (45:1.5) arc (45:270:1.5);

\draw[MOrange, dashed] (0,0) -- (45:1.5);
\draw[MOrange, thick, -stealth] (0:1) arc (0:45:1) node[midway,right,font=\scriptsize] {start};

\draw[MGreen, thick, -stealth] (45:0.5) arc (45:270:0.5) node[midway, left, font=\scriptsize] {sweep};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Fillable Arcs
- The `GArc` class is a `GFillableObject`, and so you can call `.set_filled()` on a `GArc` object
- Filled like a pie-shaped wedge formed between the center of the bounding box and the starting and end points of the arc

::::::cols
::::col
```python
def filled_arc():
    gw = GWindow(400, 400)
    arc = GArc(50, 50, 
			   350, 350, 
			   90, 135)
    arc.set_color("orange")
    arc.set_filled(True)
    gw.add(arc)
```

## The `GPolygon` class
- Used to represent graphical objects bounded by line segments
	- Polygons consist of several _vertices_ bounded by _edges_

![\ ](../images/GPolygons.svg)

- Location not fixed in upper left, but at some convenient reference point
- Often a convenient reference point is near the center of the object, but it doesn't need to be
- `GPolygon`s are `GFillableObject`s, so they can of course be filled

## Polygonal Construction
- The `GPolygon` function creates an **empty** polygon, which you then can add vertexes too
- Can create a vertex by calling `.add_vertex(x,y)` on the `GPolygon` object
	- `x` and `y` measured **relative to the reference point**
- Vertexes past the first can be defined in a few ways:
	- `.add_vertex(x,y)` adds another new vertex relative to the reference point
	- `.add_edge(dx,dy)` adds a new vertex relative to the preceding vertex
	- `.add_polar_edge(r, theta)` adds a new vertex relative to the previous using polar coordinates

## Triangle By Vertex
```{.python style='max-height:900px;'}
def triangle_by_vertex():
    def create_triangle(b, h):
        tri = GPolygon()
        tri.add_vertex(-b / 2, h / 2)
        tri.add_vertex(b / 2, h / 2)
        tri.add_vertex(0, -h / 2)
        return tri

    gw = GWindow(500, 500)
    triangle = create_triangle(200, 200)
    triangle.set_filled(True)
    triangle.set_color("red")
    gw.add(triangle, 250, 250)
```

## Triangle by Polar Edge
```{.python style='max-height:900px;'}
def triangle_by_polar_edge():
    def create_eq_triangle(side):
        tri = GPolygon()
        tri.add_vertex(0, 0)
        for i in range(0, 360, 120):
            tri.add_polar_edge(side, i)
        return tri

    gw = GWindow(500, 500)
    triangle = create_eq_triangle(100)
    triangle.set_filled(True)
    triangle.set_color("green")
    gw.add(triangle, 250, 250)
```

## Compound Objects
- The `GCompound` class makes it possible to combine several graphical objects so that the entire structure behaves as a single object
- Can be thought of as a combination of `GWindow` and `GObject`
	- You can objects to it, but then you can also add it (and everything in it) to a canvas as one unit
- Uses its own coordinate system relative to a reference point
	- When adding objects to the `GCompound`, you place them relative to the reference point
	- When adding the `GCompound` to a canvas, you set the location of the reference point


## And my Axe!
```{.python style='max-height:900px;'}
def my_axe():
    def create_axe():
        axe = GCompound()
        shaft = GRect(-15, 0, 30, 300)
        shaft.set_filled(True)
        shaft.set_color("brown")
        axe.add(shaft)

        blade = GPolygon()
        blade.add_vertex(0, 0)
        blade.add_vertex(200, -50)
        blade.add_vertex(200, 50)
        blade.set_filled(True)
        blade.set_color("gray")
        axe.add(blade, -80, 50)
        return axe

    gw = GWindow(500, 500)
    axe = create_axe()
    gw.add(axe, 250, 100)
```
