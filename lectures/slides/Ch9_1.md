## Announcements
- Problem Set 5 is posted and ready for you to complete!
- Make sure you attend your sections today or tomorrow about lists
- Grading progress update
	- Almost all of the PS3's got graded, I only didn't get through about 10
	- I've got the basics in place to try to give grade reports, but it is still a little manual atm. If you would like a grade report to make any decisions about withdrawing or not, just ask and I'll take the time to make one
    - All the rest of my free time at the moment is going toward grading the midterm. I'm still hoping for Friday, but we'll see. There are a lot of you.

## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: D[1][2]"}
After running the below code, how would you access the `"ninja"` element in list `D`?
```python
A = ['pirate', 'ninja']
B = ['samurai'] + A
C = [B, ['ship', 'rope', 'horse']]
D = C[::-1]
```


:::{.poll}
#. `D[1][0]`
#. `D[0][1]`
#. `D[0][2]`
#. `D[1][2]`

## 2D Arrays → Images
- Image data is commonly stored in two-dimensional arrays
- Each element stores information about the pixel that exists at that location
- The `GImage` class lets you convert between the image itself and the array representing the image contents by using the `get_pixel_array` method, which returns a two-dimensional array of integers.
- We could get the pixels from our example image using:
```python
image = GImage("VLA_Moonset.jpg")
pixels = image.get_pixel_array()
```
- The first index of the pixel array gets you the row, the second index gets you the column


## Pixel Contents
- Each element in a pixel array is an integer in which the 32 bits are interpreted as:

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=90%
[
box/.style={draw, very thick, outer sep=0pt}
]

\node[box, MPurple, text=white, font=\tt, label={[MPurple,font=\large\em]below:transparency}] (alpha) at (0,0) {1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1};
\node[box, MRed,  text=white, font=\tt, label={[MRed,font=\large\em]below: red}, right = 1mm of alpha] (red) {1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1};
\node[box, MGreen, text=white, font=\tt, label={[MGreen,font=\large\em]below: green}, right = 1mm of red] (green) {0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1};
\node[box, MBlue, text=white, font=\tt, label={[MBlue,font=\large\em]below: blue}, right = 1mm of green] (blue) {0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1};
\end{tikzpicture}

- The first byte (8 bits) is the transparency or alpha
- The next three bytes indicate the amount of red, green, and blue in the pixel, where each value varies from 0 to 255
	- Form the RGB of a color, generally expressed in hexadecimal form
		- `10010101` → `0x95`
		- `00111001` → `0x39`
		- `01100011` → `0x63`
	- Overall color: `#953963`{.no-highlight} or <svg width="100" height="40" style="display:inline"><rect width="100" height="40" style="fill:#953963"></rect></svg>


## Combining Light Colors

![Additive Colors](../images/RGB_illumination.jpg){width=60%}


## Transparency
- The first byte (8 bits) of the pixel value gives the transparency, which indicates how much of the background is allowed to show through
- Often denoted with the Greek letter alpha: $\alpha$
- Varies from 0 to 255 like the other 8 bit values:
	- 0 is entirely transparent
	- 255 is entirely opaque


## Breaking out the Colors
- You do not need to convert the pixel values yourself! PGL has built-in ways to extract the various colors

:::{style="font-size:.8em;"}

Function | Description
--- | -----
`GImage.get_red(pixel)` | Returns the integer (0-255) corresponding to the red portion of the pixel
`GImage.get_green(pixel)` | Returns the integer (0-255) corresponding to the green portion of the pixel
`GImage.get_blue(pixel)` | Returns the integer (0-255) corresponding to the blue portion of the pixel
`GImage.get_alpha(pixel)` | Returns the integer (0-255) corresponding to the alpha portion of the pixel
`GImage.create_rgb_pixel(r,g,b)` | Returns a 32-bit integer corresponding to the desired color

## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: 17 times!"}
The code for the main function of Merge Sort looked like below:
```{.python data-line-numbers=""}
def merge_sort(array):
    if len(array) > 1:
        mid = len(array)//2
        a1 = array[:mid]
        a2 = array[mid:]
        merge_sort(a1)
        merge_sort(a2)
        merge(array, a1, a2)
L = [45, 32, 68, 78, 12, 95, 312, 4, 32]
merge_sort(L)
```
How many times (including line 10) does `merge_sort` get called before the list is sorted?

## Standard Complexity Classes

Name | Big-O | Example
---|---|---
constant | $\mathcal{O}(1)$ | Finding the first element of an array
logarithmic | $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ | Binary search in a sorted array
linear | $\mathcal{O}(N)$ | Summing over an array, or linear search
$N \log N$ | $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ | Merge sort
quadratic | $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ | Selection sort
cubic | $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ | Obvious algorithms for matrix multiplication
exponential | $\mathcal{O}(2^N)$ | Branch and try all possibilities

- In general, any problem who complexity can not be expressed as a polynomial is considered _intractable_

## Image Thresholding
::::::cols
::::col
- As an example of reading and manipulating pixel values, lets look at how we could threshold the image to the right
- Thresholding is when you take a grayscale image and convert it to a black and white image, where a pixel is set to be white if it is above a certain threshold in brightness
- Grayscale, so each RGB component is the same
- Let's threshold at a value of 30

## Thresholding Code
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:.8em;'}
from pgl import GWindow, GImage

def threshold(e):
    thresh_value = 30
    height = len(pixels)
    width = len(pixels[0])
    new_array = [[0 for i in range(width)] for i in range(height)]
    for r in range(height):
        for c in range(width):
            if GImage.get_red(pixels[r][c]) > thresh_value:
                new_array[r][c] = GImage.create_rgb_pixel(0, 255, 0)
            else:
                new_array[r][c] = GImage.create_rgb_pixel(0, 0, 0)
    new_image = GImage(new_array)
    gw.add(new_image)

gw = GWindow(800, 525)
image = GImage("Moon.png")
gw.add(image)
pixels = image.get_pixel_array()
gw.add_event_listener("click", threshold)
```


## An Object's Purpose
- Python uses the concepts of objects and classes ta achieve at least three different goals:
	- __Aggregation__. Objects make it possible to represent collections of independent data as a single unit. Such collections are traditionally called _records_.
	- __Encapsulation__. Classes make it possible to store data together with the operations that manipulate that data.
		- In Python the data values are called _attributes_ and the operations are called _methods_
	- __Inheritance__. Class hierarchies make it possible for a class that shares some attributes and methods with a previously defined class to _inherit_ those definitions without rewriting them all
- For about the next week and a half we'll be working through these


## Old Records
- Records are a very old idea, dating back to the 19th centure BCE
- Frequently pressed into clay
- In 2017, researchers established that the below tablet records Pythagorean triples!

![The Plimpton 322 Tablet](../images/Plimpton_322.jpg){width=40%}


## Recording Dickens
- Suppose we had some records from the two-employee firm Scrooge and Marley
- Each contains the employee name, their title, and their salary

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=70%
[record/.style={draw, minimum width=4cm, font=\tt},
lab/.style={font=\tt\small, anchor=south west},
]
\node[record, MGreen](n) at (0,0) {"Ebenezer Scrooge"};
\node[lab, MGreen](nl) at (n.north west) {name};
\node[record, MGreen, below=.75cm of n](t){"founder"};
\node[lab, MGreen] at (t.north west) {title};
\node[record, MGreen, below=.75cm of t](s) {1000};
\node[lab, MGreen] at (s.north west) {salary};
\node[fit=(nl)(s), draw, very thick, MGreen] {};

\node[record, MBlue](n) at (5,0) {"Bob Cratchit"};
\node[lab, MBlue](nl) at (n.north west) {name};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of n](t) {"clerk"};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (t.north west) {title};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of t](s) {15};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (s.north west) {salary};
\node[fit=(nl)(s), draw, very thick, MBlue] {};

\end{tikzpicture}

## Tuple Time
- In Python, simplest strategy for representing a record uses the built-in type _tuple_
	- An ordered, **immutable** sequence of values
- Feel similar to lists, except immutable, and used very differently
	- Think of tuples as more like records than lists
- Created by enclosing a collection of elements in parentheses
`employee = ("Bob Cratchit", "clerk", 15)`{.inlinecode}
- Stored internally similarly to a list, so each element has a corresponding index

## Tuple Usage
- Can largely envision tuples as sitting between strings and lists
	- Immutable, like strings
	- Elements can be _anything_, like lists
- Common operations mimic that of strings
	- Can concatenate with addition
	- Can duplicate by multiplying by an integer
	- Can index and slice them
	- Can loop over them directly or via index
- A tuple of a single value **needs** a comma still in order to be a tuple


## Tuple Selection
- You can select or slice elements from a tuple just like you can with lists
	- Unfortunately, records are not usually ordered in a particular way. Rather, it is the name that is usually important
- If using tuples, you can make programs more readable by using a _destructuring assignment_, which breaks a tuple into named components:
`name, title, salary = employee`{.inlinecode .no-highlight}
- While modern versions of Python have such thing as a _named tuple_, we will not look at them here.
	- The more general strategy is to define a new class to better represent the objects in question

## Classes vs Objects
- When we introduced PGL early in the semester, we stressed the difference between classes and objects
	- A _class_ is the pattern or template that defines the structure and behavior of values with that particular type (the species of ant)
	- An _object_ is an individual value that belongs to a class (an individual ant)
		- A single class can be used to create any number of objects, each of which is said to be an _instance_ of that class
- PGL defines the `GRect` class.
	- In Breakout, you used that class to create **many** different rectangles, each of which was an instance of the `GRect` class


## Thinking about Objects
![\ ](../images/Interface2.svg)


## Classes as Templates
- Since they share the same attributes, it is natural to regard the two employees at Scrooge and Marley as two instances of the same class
- Could view the class as a template or empty form:
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=40%
[record/.style={draw, minimum width=4cm, font=\tt},
lab/.style={font=\tt\small, anchor=south west},
]
\node[record, MBlue](n) at (0,0) {};
\node[lab, MBlue](nl) at (n.north west) {name};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of n](t){};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (t.north west) {title};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of t](s) {};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (s.north west) {salary};
\node[fit=(nl)(s), draw, very thick, MBlue] {};
\end{tikzpicture}

- Can help initially to just start with an empty template and then fill in the necessary fields

## Starting Empty
- Class definitions in Python start with a header line consisting of the keyword `class` and then the class name
- The body of the class will later contain definitions, but initially can just leave black
	- Almost. Python does not allow an empty body, so need to include a docstring or `pass`
```python
class Employee:
	"""This class is currently empty!"""
```
- Once the class is defined, you can create an object of this class type by calling the class as if it were a function:
```python
clerk = Employee()
```

## More References
- Objects, like all values, are stored as _references_ to that information in memory
- Any code with access to this reference can manipulate the object
	- Can get or set the contents of any attributes or create new ones
