## Review Question

::::::cols
::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.5'}
Karel starts as shown to the right with 20 beepers in its bag. After executing the commands below, how many beepers are left in the bag upon the conclusion of the program?

```python
while left_is_clear():
	while front_is_clear():
		move()
		if no_beepers_present():
			put_beeper()
	turn_left()
```

\karelmark[fill=MYellow]{1}{1}{0}
\draw[very thick, MGreen] (.5,2.5) --++(1,0) --++(0,-1)--++(2,0)--++(0,1)--++(1,0)

## Counting Loops
- Sometimes we **know** the number of times we want to loop
	- It is not dependent on some condition like a while loop
- In these circumstances, the iterative statement called a _for_ loop is best used
- Syntax looks like:

	```python
	for i in range(desired_count):
		# statements to be repeated
	```
   - `desired_count` is an _integer_ indicating the number of times you want the loop to repeat
   - The `i` is a name that we will later make more general, but for now you can always leave it as an `i`


## An Example `for` you 
::::::cols
::::col
- Suppose we want Karel to create a 6x6 square outline of beepers in a room
- Need to repeat making each side 4 times
- Need to repeat placing a beeper and moving 6 times for each side
	- Placing 6 beepers requires moving only 5 times. So not everything can be in the loop
::::
::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{10}{10}
\foreach \x in {3,4,5,6,7,8}{
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{\x}{3};
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{\x}{8};
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{3}{\x};
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{8}{\x};
}
\karelmark[MYellow]{3}{3}{0}
\end{tikzpicture}

## A Potential Solution
```{.python style="max-height: 900px"}
import karel

def main():
    """Draw a 4x4 square in the world."""
    position()
    draw_box()

def position():
    """Move to starting corner of box."""
    move()
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    move()
    turn_right()

def turn_right():
    """Turns Karel 90 deg to the right."""
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def draw_box():
    """Draws a box with 4 equal sides in a CCW direction."""
    for i in range(4):
        draw_6_line()
        turn_left()

def draw_6_line():
    """Draws a straight line of 6 beepers, if space."""
    for i in range(5):
        if no_beepers_present():
            put_beeper()
        if front_is_clear():
            move()
    if no_beepers_present(): # Last beeper to make 6
        put_beeper()
```


## Summary So Far
::::::cols
::::col
:::{.block name="Karel Cmds"}
- Karel can only:
	- `move()`
	- `turn_left()`
	- `pick_beeper()`
	- `put_beeper()`
- Can get info about surroundings using predicate functions
	- Eg. `front_is_clear()`
	- Inverse options exist as well
:::

:::{.block name="Functions"}
- Group code into bundles
```python
def function_name():
	# Code to be grouped
```
:::
::::

::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.5'}
:::{.block name="Control Statements"}
- Conditional statements
	- Run certain code blocks only if a condition is true
	```python
	if condition_test:
		# Code if answer yes
	else:
		# Code if answer no
	```
- Iterative statements
	- `while` loop: repeat code block as long as condition is true
	```python
	while condition_test:
		# Code to repeat
	```
	- `for` loop: repeat set number of times
	```python
	for i in range(desired_count):
		# Code to repeat
	```

## Algorithms
- The process of designing a solution strategy to a problem is called _algorithmic design_
- An _algorithm_ is just an approach or recipe for a method to solve a particular problem
	- Frequently language agnostic
- Algorithms are not a new concept
	- Euclids algorithm to find greatest common denominators for instance
- A large part of computer science is focused on the study or analysis of algorithms

## Algorithm â®• Code
- You need to have an algorithm in place **before** you can write the code to tell the computer what you want to do
	- Imagine an alien asking me how to bake a cake. I need to understand the steps to baking the cake before I can even worry about the translation or communication
- Programming tools like conditional statements and loops will frequently play a role in your algorithm, but as general concepts
	- I can easily describe a loop to you without needing the exact syntax of Python
- The implementation of the algorithm is the act of translating it into Python (or whatever language you are using)

## An Amazing Algorithm
::::::cols
::::col
- Consider a simple, loop-less, maze that we want to move through
- A common algorithm to get through the maze is to essentially always follow or touch the wall to your right
- Practically speaking, this largely means to go forward unless a passage opens to your right, in which case you take that passage
- In Karel, if the exit was a beeper, we might implement the above algorithm as:

::::

::::col
```{.python .fragment style='max-height:900px; font-size: .75em;'}
while no_beepers_present():
	# if opening on right, we follow
	if right_is_clear():
		turn_right()
		move()
	else:
		# go forward if possible or turn
		if front_is_clear():
			move()
		else:
			turn_left()
```

## Complications
- More complicated problems will generally result or require more complex and longer code
- _Stepwise Refinement_ is the process of starting with the biggest problem and breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces
	- Eventually, you should be able to solve one of those pieces with a fairly straightforward piece of code
- Taking some time to plan ahead will save you a lot of time coding!
	- Sketch out how you want to break the problem up, before you start coding
	- Things can always shift some later if you realize something while writing the code

## Example: Pillar Repair
- Suppose Karel comes across some arches which have broken pillars supporting them.
- Our goal is to have Karel repair the pillars by filling in the missing beepers

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=60%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{13}{8}
\draw[very thick, MGreen] (0.5,5.5) \foreach \c in {1,2,3} {
									-| ++(1,1) -| ++(1,1) -| ++(1,-1) -| ++(1,-1)
									} --++(1,0);
\karelmark[fill=MYellow]{1}{1}{0}
\foreach \y in {4,5} \karelbeeper[fill=MBlue]{1}{\y};
\foreach \y in {1,2,4} \karelbeeper[fill=MBlue]{5}{\y};
\foreach \y in {4,5} \karelbeeper[fill=MBlue]{9}{\y};
\foreach \y in {1,3,5} \karelbeeper[fill=MBlue]{13}{\y};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Breaking it down
![A potential breakdown](../images/Pillar_Fixing.svg)

## A potential solution
```{.python style='max-height: 900px;'}
import karel


def rebuild_arches():
    while front_is_clear():
        repair_pillar()
        move()
    repair_pillar()


def repair_pillar():
    turn_left()
    # Beeper chain up
    create_beeper_chain()
    turn_around()
    # Beeper chain back down
    create_beeper_chain()
    turn_left()


def turn_around():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()


def create_beeper_chain():
    while front_is_clear():
        if beepers_present():
            move()
            if no_beepers_present():
                put_beeper()
        else:
            move()
```
